&lt;p>One would guess that I should have known better with the work experience I accumulated in the software engineering field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday evening, after our social team meeting, and I am still excited to finish something substantial for this feature that I&amp;rsquo;m working. Lots of moving parts, refactored code, loose ends, and hastily glued together code without any safety net. A couple of new unit tests for the new feature and some legacy code that I have to touch. Very picky and sensible legacy code. I&amp;rsquo;m careful not to break any existing and battlefield-proven code that is used by ~25M monthly active users across multiple products. Run the existing unit tests between more considerable changes and ensure that it stays in the green.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
