&lt;p>I have an &lt;a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/890" title="AxiDraw V3/A3">AxiDraw V3/A3&lt;/a> Penplotter that I bought to satisfy a desire to own such a fantastic machine. It started in my teen years working with &lt;a href="http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=4&amp;amp;cat=24" title="HP Plotters">HP Plotters&lt;/a> in our university lab at the &lt;a href="https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/en/startpage.html" title="TUHH">TUHH&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>A friend of mine asked me if I could build something useful with my 3D Printer. He wanted to have something to place his new (and expensive) tamper for ground coffee. I always wanted to design and print something useful on my 3D Printer. And I wanted to learn and use &lt;a href="https://www.OpenSCAD.org/" title="OpenSCAD">OpenSCAD&lt;/a> for a long time. Now I had an excellent reason to learn it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
