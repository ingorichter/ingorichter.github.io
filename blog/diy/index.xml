&lt;p&gt;I already updated my 3D Printer fan shroud a couple of months ago. It should cool the filament more effectively and evenly. I think it did a good job. Unfortunately, the shroud got too hot several times and was deformed. I was afraid that it now had reduced cooling performance. I found an update to the fan shroud that looked very efficient, and somebody analyzed the airflow, and it appeared to be very effective in cooling the filament.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day350</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-350"&gt;WFH Day 350&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already the last day of a perfect month. Perfect in that sense that the month started with a Monday and ended adequately on a Sunday. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that I was about to create my sourdough starter. It was an experiment, and I failed it. I assume that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right place in my house with sufficient constant temperature (this house is so badly insulated :-|). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that I don&amp;rsquo;t have ice flowers on the windows on some mornings. Anyway, my experiment failed, and the dough didn&amp;rsquo;t rise as needed. I thought that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to make my bread with my starter by the end of February. I will give it another try, and this time I will place the starter in the Bathroom. That seems to be the warmest place in the house. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this will work out.
Failed experiments are part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day329</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-329"&gt;WFH Day 329&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new year, and still, we are mostly trapped and confined in our homes without much todo. The days seem to follow the same pattern day in, day out. I went back to exercise more, not to feel brain tired, and have something accomplished with my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
