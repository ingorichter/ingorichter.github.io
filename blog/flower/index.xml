&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s already the last day of a perfect month. Perfect in that sense that the month started with a Monday and ended adequately on a Sunday. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/">post&lt;/a> that I was about to create my sourdough starter. It was an experiment, and I failed it. I assume that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right place in my house with sufficient constant temperature (this house is so badly insulated :-|). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that I don&amp;rsquo;t have ice flowers on the windows on some mornings. Anyway, my experiment failed, and the dough didn&amp;rsquo;t rise as needed. I thought that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to make my bread with my starter by the end of February. I will give it another try, and this time I will place the starter in the Bathroom. That seems to be the warmest place in the house. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this will work out.
Failed experiments are part of the learning process.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
