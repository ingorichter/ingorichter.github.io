## WFH Day 353

I didn't sleep too bad last night. I got up at around 7:15 am, made myself a coffee, and continued to read my current book [Gerta](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55505679-gerta). I'm a slow reader, and if I don't put time aside for reading, I will never finish any longer book in a finite amount of time. Reading in bed at night is something that doesn't work for me. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly, and then my Kindle, or even worse, my iPad, falls to my face. If I start reading in the morning or during lunch break, I have a real chance to finish a book. I challenged myself to read 20 books this year. I need to increase the pace; otherwise, I won't make it.

I was reading [this post](https://elainecchao.medium.com/9-life-lessons-from-a-year-of-shelter-in-place-26de1ea19b2d) by my co-worker today. It's an excellent summary of the last year. I can't entirely agree with every aspect of the post, but overall, it covers many topics that kept me and others around me busy and thinking.

Sometimes people ask me what I'm reading or Music/Podcast I'm listening to right now. If you asked me, I would tell you that I started listening to [Renegades](https://open.spotify.com/show/42xagXCUDsFO6a0lcHoTlv?si=kMkXPdnfTwWiB4wr-yclMA) on Spotify. It's a casual conversation between Barack Obama and Bruce "The Boss" Springsteen. I like both of them for various reasons, and they talk about their upbringing and the current state of the World. I was listening to it on my evening walk, which kept me walking a little longer. You might like it.

The tree in front of the house looks beautiful right now with all the new blossoms and this light rose color.
