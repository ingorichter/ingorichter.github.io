## WFH Day 365

I took some time during the weekend to minimize my belongings. What does that mean? I got rid of some redundant electronics in the Garage. I threw out some old clothes that clogged my closet. I organized my 3D Printer setup and reduced duplicate tools, and put the wanted stuff in some boxes to keep some order. I trashed some boxes with stuff that I didn't even remember made it during the move... There is so much more to minimize. This is an ongoing process, and I'm going to minimize every day a little bit. I'm getting step by step closer to the goal of having less stuff in my life. Only what I want and what gives me happiness.

I was reading [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/business/roxane-gay-work-friend-work-from-home.html) in the New York Times last weekend. I know it's even from the previous week, but I'm a slow reader of the paper version of the NY Times.
The author describes how her life has been turned upside down during the last year, adapted to the WFH environment, and the challenges that those changes brought to her life. The people she is missing during her workday.The ones that she has spent the majority of her time during the day. The questions about what's important moving forward. What do we want after this period of extreme social deprivation? Questions that some of us might have had in the past couple of months. It's so relatable. It's so true, IMHO. Perhaps you will read the article and share your thoughts with me.

Monday last week, we had another, highly appreciated, an additional day off from Work. I spent some time in Halfmoon Bay on the beach. It was cold and sunny. I had some time to walk along the beach and take some pictures without any rushing. It was a great day, and you can see one of the photos I took below.
