## WFH Day 178

In addition to work from home we got really bad air quality. We didn't see the sun since yesterdays orange tint. Today was not as bad as yesterday, but still no sun and it was gloomy as hell. This doesn't give you any energy boost to get through the day. And don't think about outside exercise. Trying to do something healthy gets in the way with the outside conditions.
