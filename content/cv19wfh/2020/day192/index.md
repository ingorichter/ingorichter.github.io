## WFH Day 192

We are approaching the final days of our Sprint. The majority of our clients are happy and don't have significant functionality issues that would require our team to do some fire fighting. I was able to finish one last-minute task for a hotfix and another task for this release. In addition to finalizing both tasks, I was able to review some PRs and provide some feedback. I feel pretty accomplished today, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Last workday of this week ðŸŒ¸

The picture shows what I'm sometimes doing for my afternoon break after I finished some work. Brewing coffee the old fashioned way. Beans, Grinder, Paper filter, Chemex, and hot water. And don't forget the scale and the timer. This ritual shifts the focus towards the coffee smell and the great taste of a freshly made coffee.
