## WFH Day 182

That is a looong time that we are now hanging out at home. We won't go back to the office anytime soon. So, we are stuck inside our homes for much longer. And because of the horrible air quality I can't even go outside and exercise. It seems that this year brings all the catastrophes (pandemic, global warming, extreme heat and wildfires) in one go. This is usual material that science fictions stories are made of. Now we have to live through it in reality. We will all be alright. Some way or the other. No time to worry about it.

Let's add a picture to have something nicer to look at.
