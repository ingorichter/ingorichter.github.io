## WFH Day 183

How many T-shirts do I need? I did laundry today and was folding up my stuff. I was looking in my closet and found at least 20 T-Shirts and the additional pile of 15 T-shirts freshly laundered. I need to get rid of some of them. There is so much stuff in my life that it distracts me from more important things. I have this pile of desk supplies lying on the ground next to my desk. I have a todo item on my list to put them into the drawer or throw them away. I think tomorrow will be a fine day to start doing that.

The air quality was much better than the last couple of days. Time to go on my evening walk through the neighborhood again.

And now something for sore eyes.
