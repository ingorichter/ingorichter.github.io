## WFH Day 184

What a day. A lot of meetings in the morning. After I finished all of them right before the lunch break, I found [Beat Burnout And Zoom Fatigue: 3 Ways To Fight Stress And Stay Motivated During Coronavirus](https://apple.news/AJDAk76ilQYm-ssffOZlwog) in my news feed today. Although I consider myself mindful and remind myself to take breaks during the day, exercise my aching body, I still sometimes feel tired and not motivated to my full extent. I don't know if it's a result of all the meetings to stay connected with my teammates and friends and family. But I can feel the pressure that is building up. The pace is high, and the work seems to be endless. It's unlikely that I'm running out of tasks, but I need to be more disciplined about stopping on time and not going back to work after dinner. I will do better tomorrow.

I'm happy that I was able to do some core exercises for 20 minutes. It was giving me a different form of challenge, and it was tiring. I should sleep well tonight. And I hope that I'll be able to lift my arms tomorrow morning.

And now something for the eyes. I believe that looking at something green should be relaxing to the eyes. ;-)
