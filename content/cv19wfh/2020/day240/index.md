## WFH Day 240

After some time off last week, I'm finally back to work. I felt mentally exhausted and tired to the point of not having any motivation to do anything despite reading, hanging around, and sleeping. I made silly mistakes during the last minute changes that my teammates had to fix while I was gone. And to be honest, that wasn't a great feeling.

I feel better now, and I have more energy to tackle some of the more challenging work problems.
The most significant change for me recently was to walk and run daily. It's freeing up my mind, and I feel great that my watch tells me that I accomplished my move and exercise goals at the end of the day. Mission accomplished.

This morning a met a longtime friend for a 3 1/2 mile walk around the nearby lake. The weather was not so great (as usual this time of year here in Germany), but walking and talking was a great way to connect with my friend after a long time. So, it was a great day after all.
