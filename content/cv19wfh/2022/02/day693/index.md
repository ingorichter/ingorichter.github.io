## WFH Day 693

I'm back in California for a week now, and my Jetlag is finally gone. Every time I travel to Germany, it feels like it'll take longer to recover. And this week, I had a lot of meetings and tons of work to finish our development sprint. Not great, but I punched through it.

Regarding the Jetlag: I tried many things to get back to my rhythm faster, but it didn't seem to work well enough. I exercised every day, and I went to bed around 11 pm every night. I tried to eat healthy as well as I could, no alcohol but lots of water and coffee.

Anyway, I'm back, and I enjoy being in a warmer climate, riding my bicycle in the sun, and using my water rower in the Garage.

BTW: I took the picture shortly after takeoff from Munich Airport. There were a lot of clouds and strong windsâ€”the reason my flight was canceled the previous day.

If you like weird TV Shows that sometimes seem absurd and funny, I can recommend [How To With John Wilson](https://www.hbo.com/how-to-with-john-wilson). It's on HBO. Ask a friend if you don't have your account ;-)

Have a great week, and enjoy whatever you like to do.
