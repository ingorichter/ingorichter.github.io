## WFH Day 946

I had some random thoughts the other day.

The invention of Smartphones and the evolution of built-in cameras was a big step forward in reducing friction to asking random people at scenic spots to take a picture of yourself. Do you remember the days you had to instruct people how to use the camera? How to focus, and which button to press before taking a picture? All this instructional talk was eliminated when smartphones started to take over our lives.

Nowadays, you will hand your phone to somebody without giving them instructions on how to take a picture. Everybody knows that you tap on the screen to set the focus. And the volume button or the on-screen button will take a picture. You can even let them take multiple shots to ensure that there will be at least one usable shot from you. And you can right away check the photo and share it with whoever you think is worth it.
