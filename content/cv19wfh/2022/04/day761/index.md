## WFH Day 761

Thanks for my employer I had an additional Day Off. To take care of myself and spent time away from my Computer.

I went out for a hike up Mission Peak in Fremont, California. I heard about it and wanted to do it for quite some time.
It was a great adventure. It was tough and I was tired like hell afterwards. I got a sunburn in my face. Not great.

I was crawling up the hill and I was a strong reminder for myself to exercise more.

It was beautiful out there. The sunshine, the Hanglider and the Paraglider were flying over my head, there was a bunch of people walking up to the top to the mountain top. There were cows left and right on the pasture. Turkeys gobbled around and enjoyed the place among other animals.

Half way up to the top I was so tired and exhausted, that I was thinking about returning early. I sat on a bench and looked over the Bay Area. Another struggling hiker crawled up the hill and didn't look happy at all. We started chatting and continued out ascend. We were slow, but we talked about some many different things. We had a couple of stops along the way, but it was easier than doing it alone. He was carrying a 25 pound backback with food, water, a tent, clothes and some other survival equipment. He told me about him volunteering for a Search and Rescue troop in the Cental Valley. Kudos my friend! That's a huge achievement to carry a heady backpack up the mountain.

I was happy to arrive at the top and enjoy the great view in every direction. Bay Area, San Francisco, Mount Diablo, Livermore, Dublin, Fremont and the Central Valley in the distance.

It took us an hour to descend to the parking lot. I was tired and happy. My knees and feet hurt, but this all was not important. I made it to the top and I had a great day.
