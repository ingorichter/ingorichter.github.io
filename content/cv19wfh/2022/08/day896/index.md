## WFH Day 896

I'm working on too many things at once. The most important one is to replace my Synology NAS with a new one that I built from scratch. My friend was always telling me how great and reliable his [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com) system is working for him. Now, I'm replacing my Synology NAS with a more powerful TrueNAS system with a more powerful CPU, RAM and Storage. It's a steep learning curve to find my way configuring the new machine. It's also a great way to clean up my existing data storage and rethink some of the services I have running on my old NAS. I believe that it's the right thing to do with the new NAS. More commodity hardware and less vendor lock in. Never a boring day and always something new to learn.

## Reading

I got better this year, reading more books.

Recently I finished [Winter is Coming](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20010616W/Winter_is_coming?edition=ia%3Awinteriscomingwh0000kasp_r8m4) from Garry Kasparov. Interesting information about the relationship of Russia and the rest of the world. I learned a lot of things about the current political situation and how it developed in the past 50 years.

I started to read [Someday is Today](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25591329W/Someday_Is_Today) from Matthew Dicks. I'm at the beginning of the book and there are a lot of things that I already can relate to. It's easy to read and Matthew is a great storyteller, and it's a joy to read.

## Photography

I finally spent some time in San Francisco on a Sunday night to walk around [North Beach](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/140983204#map=17/37.80118/-122.40900).
I took pictures of the sunset, some alleys and the [Sentinel Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Tower_(San_Francisco)

Here is my long exposure night shot of the building.

Notice the Rainbow Colored top of the Salesforce Tower.

Thanks for reading.
