## ðŸ“º What I'm watching

- [Fubar](https://www.netflix.com/title/81397077)

## ðŸ§° What I'm making

- Working on a web app to build workout routines with timing and repetition information
- Experimenting with SVG layer separation based on color of the image
- I want a new theme for my blog, since the current theme is no longer maintained

## ðŸ”¬ What I'm learning

- Front End Master - TypeScript (this is a lot of stuff)
- How to use FreeCAD
- Transition my old Synology NAS to a the TrueNAS machine. I still have one service to transition and the provided app doesn't work for me. So, I have to find another way to get it going. Probably in the good old fashioned docker-compose way
