## New Years' Eve

And another year passed by quickly. Too many things happened left and rightâ€”good and bad things to remember, although I'd like to focus on the positive ones personally.

The world changed so dramatically last year that it feels tiring for nearly everybody I know. Those changes seem to suck the energy and air out of our lives. Everybody wants something that feels normal. Normal compared to the life we had before everything started to change so dramatically.

I don't know if there is a way back to what many of us considered normal once. It looks more like we need to adapt to something new. We need to adjust our lives to cope with the looming and ongoing catastrophes around the world. We need to accept that we depend on so many fragile systems around the globe. We have to consider other motives when we consume. Perhaps cheap doesn't work anymore. If it's cheap for us, somebody else pays a higher price to provide that cheap good. I will keep this in mind the next time I purchase something. Be it food or other goods.

I don't remember having experienced times of that level of uncertainty and change growing up. But I believe in good things to happen. After each downturn, there will be a way out of the misery, and things will improve. Slowly and steadily.

Spending the last hours of this year with friends, I must not sink into despair and hopelessness. I'll focus on the good things I can do for myself, my family, my friends, or anybody needing help and support.

Keep smiling and stay positive. Let's welcome the new year.

ðŸ¥‚ ðŸŽ‰ Happy New Year 2023!
