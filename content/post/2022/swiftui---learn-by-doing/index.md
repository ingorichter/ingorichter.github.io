## SwiftUI - Learn by doing

I briefly started to use SwiftUI in 2021. I wanted to learn about the fundamentals and how SwiftUI differs from the traditional iOS and macOS development frameworks.

Over the next couple of weeks, I will provide tutorials to help others learn SwiftUI by building some apps. I'm going to start building a Minesweeper clone. Minesweeper is a simple game that I loved to play when it was released with Windows 3.1 in 1990. The game idea itself is older, according to [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game>).
Building it for iOS and macOS is a great way to use SwiftUI and share code among both platforms. And creating an old game on a modern platform seemed to be a great exercise. Learning how to make something look like a Windows Program on macOS and iOS seemed like a fun way to learn UI styling and bend code to your will.

So, if you are interested in following the tutorial, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ingorichter) or use the RSS feed to receive updates.

Until then, happy coding!
