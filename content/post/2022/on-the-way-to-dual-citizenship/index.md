## 13 Months...

... after filing the application to keep my German citizenship, I got an email today, letting me know that my application was accepted, and I was granted the permission to [retain my German citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beibehaltungsgenehmigung) when applying for the US citizenship. Yes ðŸ¤˜!

Now, I need to make an appointment to pick up my certificate from the German Consulate in San Francisco. And then start the [N-400](https://www.uscis.gov/n-400) process to become a US Citizen.

One step closer.
