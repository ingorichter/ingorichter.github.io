I like to learn new tools, programming languages, and exciting topics.
I recently found the book [Genetic Algorithms in Java Basics](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484203293) , and I found the code samples easy enough to understand to "translate" them to a different programming language for the sole purpose of getting some hands-on experience with a new programming language.
I'm done with the 2nd chapter of the book and implemented the genetic algorithm described in that chapter to crystal lang.

The source code is available from my [github repo](https://github.com/ingorichter/GeneticAlgorithms/tree/master/geneticAlgo).

If you find it useful clone it and if you have feedback, then file an issue or submit a pull request.
