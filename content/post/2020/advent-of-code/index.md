# Ho Ho Ho

Now that we approach the last month of this extraordinary year, I'm looking forward to some coding challenges to distract myself and learn something new. And here it comes [AdventOfCode][1]. Sign in with any of the social accounts mentioned on their page and start solving the daily puzzles. The programming language doesn't matter. You can produce the solution with whatever language/tool you like.
And don't forget to check [AdventOfCode Subreddit][2] for hints, help, and the solutions others have produced.

I'll post my solutions under [github repo][3]. Looking back to the previous years, I can say that I haven't been too successful :-)

I will do it anyway, and it will be fun and challenging. So, let the fun begin.
