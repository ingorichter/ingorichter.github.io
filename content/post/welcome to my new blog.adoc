After a long time, I'm finally moving my blog to this new github hosted location.
Cleaner setup, easier to maintain and independent from any content management system.

This will be home to all new posts in the future. There will be tweaks to the setup and layout in the next couple of days. It's not perfect yet, but I wanted to get it going.
The blog will be available under this https://ingo-richter.io[domain].

I hope you will find something useful here.

Hope to see you soon. Stay tuned.
