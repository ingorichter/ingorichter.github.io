You should dump WhatsApp now! Right, that's easier said than done. Everybody, or at least the majority of your friends and family, is using this versatile Messenger. It started out as a cheap replacement for the ridiculous expensive text messages in some countries around the world. People were flocking to it to safe money and stay connected. Over time there were nice features added to make the Messenger even more appealing and useful. It was all great and beautiful until...the all and mighty facebook entered the stage and paid an insane amount of money (~20bn) for WhatsApp. People were still wondering what facebook might want with another messenger? They already had an messenger of their own. But the move to buy WhatsApp was too obvious. The technology behind WhatsApp was not so appealing, but the amount of users was what they are looking for. Especially the ones that didn't have a facebook account yet. Room to grow your company on the cheap. That's what companies to. If you can't grow fast enough, then you acquire another company to get bigger. This happens all the time and there is nothing wrong with it. Companies exist to make money selling their product. But what's the product that I'm talking about? Right, it's you and your data! This is why you obviously don't pay any money for using WhatsApp and facebook. You agreed a long time ago, that you are willing to share your data with WhatsApp and facebook. What data? I don't know, but neither do you. That's a secret and probably won't be revealed by facebook anytime soon. But that's not the point. They collected data that you had to provide when you signed up for WhatsApp: your name, phone number, location, etc. 

After trying to combine accounts from WhatsApp with the existing data from facebook, it's now clear that facebooked waited long enough to try monetize WhatsApp. However this will looks like. Perhaps some ads in your chat history or annoying popups when you don't expect them. I believe that there are tons of opportunities to get in your way and make the experience unpleasant.

At the beginning of 2021, WhatsApp asked every user to accept their new terms of use and that you agree to your data being shared. This alone is something that the European Union didn't want to happen when they agreed on the acquisition of WhatsApp by facebook. But here we are. Since this did't go well with a lot of users they pushed out the acceptance of the new terms until mid May. But the acceptance of the terms was still something that users didn't like. Some users accepted it, because it's not clear what is shared in addition to what is already shared, some people don't care at all and other, and a bunch of people didn't except them at all.
Now, here comes the interesting part: since begging and threating didn't work, facebook will now start to remove functionally gradually from WhatsApp. First you'll lose this, then that and at some point the app is no longer useful until you accept the new terms and conditions. That's a bad experience and that's what they want for you. That's basically blackmailing the userbase. Eat or die. They don't care about you and they aren't your friends.
And it's not about money. You could argue to pay some money for the service and no data will be collected about you. Or at least tell you which data is collected and keep it to a minimum to provide the service. But this is not an option. Your data is more worth that those lousy bucks you might be willing to pay. You are the product and you are generating more money by using WhatsApp. This has more value than anything else.

Cripple Software

You don't want to share your data, I cripple the software 

Why paying might not even solve that problem?
