## Happy Thanksgiving

I wish everybody a great day with their families and friends. I hope you can all meet in person and make up for last year.
I'm grateful for having a family and friends, a roof over my head, and a fulfilling job.

Happy Turkey Day, or whatever suits your mood.
Stay safe wherever you are and get some time for yourself.

Cheers ðŸ¥‚
