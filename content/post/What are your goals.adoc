# What Are Your Goals

*Happy New Year!*

In my last http://ingo-richter.io/post/Get%20Up%20And%20Start%20Walking/[blog post] (already from last year), I was talking about making changes in your life to achieve those changes. I asked you to create a plan and start following the required steps to reach your goal(s).

You don't have to wait until the start of a new year. For a bunch of people this date has some symbolic meaning. It seems to be a good starting point to reset and re-evaluate your goals. It doesn't matter what time of year you make a plan and start following your goals.

Let's have a look at the plan.

## The Actionable Plan
I don't know how your plan looks like. I guess you have created a list with all goals you want to achieve in the next weeks, months, years or in general in your life.
I have a list of goals that I want to accomplish this year. Some of the goals rolled over from 2016. I consider them not fully accomplished in 2016 and I want to continue working on them. These rolled-over goals might be long term goals or even life goals.

How many goals did you put on your list? 3? 5? 7? 10? More? Do they have all the some importance to you? What is the most important goal for you? Are they all equally important?

The plan must be actionable
break down big goals into smaller Goals
track your progress towards your goals (how do you know that you've achieved them)

Most important:

- get rid of unrealistic goals
- get rid of anything that you don't really want. It's a drag to hang on to something that you don't really want

This is a great closing for the upcoming week. Think about what you want to reach. How can you get there?. It doesn't have to be the perfect plan. But hey: you want to reach that goal.
So, make a plan and act according to your plan.

Leave a comment below if you want to share your plan with me.

Talk to you next week.
