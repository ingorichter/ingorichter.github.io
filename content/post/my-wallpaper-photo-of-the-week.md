## My Wallpaper Photo of the Week

Every Monday, I'll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week. I'll give a description of the subject, where it was taken and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by myself. I'll release them in the highest availble quality. If you like a photo, you can **download it for your personal use**. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and year.

Please read below if you want to license a photo or use it for something different altogether.

### Motivation
Why am I releasing some of my pictures for free? The reason is, that I took so many photos in the past couple of years, that I think it's really a shame to burry them somewhere on my computer. I don't look at them that often, but every time I do, I'm surprised and happy for what I found.

Some people told me, that they like my photos. I always feel humbled by that. I want to enjoy some of the photos myself by using them as wallpaper for my desktop. Perhaps you find a photo that you like too.

Some final Notes:

- This is no competition
- If you have any questions about a photo, please leave a comment in the section below
- Share your thoughts in the comment section below

### Copyright and Licensing
Please contact me if you want to use a photo in a commercial context (you will make money with it). Using it as wallpaper on your phone, tablet, notebook, desktop machine is alright. You are not allowed to remove the watermark.
