I’m Ingo — a senior computer scientist with decades of experience shipping code that matters. I’ve built scalable SDKs, led agile teams, and automated more things than I can count. When I’m not wrangling TypeScript or writing Rust, you’ll find me designing laser-cut ornaments, plotting pen art, or chasing sunlight on a titanium road bike.

I’m obsessed with clean workflows, great tools, and making things better—whether that’s debugging CI pipelines or helping teams stay focused on what really matters. I build, I share, and yes—I’m on a mission to make all this experience count (and maybe even get a little wealthy along the way).
