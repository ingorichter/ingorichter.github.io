## WFH Day 186

Today was a great day! You may ask why it was a great day. Let me tell you that my employer is giving us a day off. On Fridays. Every three weeks. Until the end of the year! If this is not great, I don't know how to spark some fun. At least for the moment.
I don't know when it was the last time that I needed an additional day to recover. I love my job. For sure, it has its ups and downs. But in general, I love what I do. But I feel tired recently, and everything seems to need a lot of energy to move it forward. I don't know if it's only me or a sign of the circumstances we currently live through. I'm thankful to have a job and contribute to something that means something to me. But it doesn't always spark joy.

I used part of the day to go outside and ride my bicycle for nearly 3 hours over 35 miles and almost 2500 ft elevation. I enjoyed nature, the quietness, and the sun on my body. It was challenging since I didn't work out enough in the past couple of months. But I climbed up the mountains and was happy that I made it to the top. The view was excellent, the air quality was great, and I felt a sense of accomplishment that I could push myself up against that mountain. I felt like a winner. Excellent after months of pushing through work items, meetings, the pandemic, my family living distributed in different countries.
I was so tired and my legs cramped when I arrived back at home. Nonetheless, I felt alive, although my muscles being sore, and my body aching. But better this way than dead.

Here is a picture from the top of the mountain that I climbed.
