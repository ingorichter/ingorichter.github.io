## WFH Day 218

Today was the day! [Adobe MAX](https://max.adobe.com) arrived, and all the work of the previous months could be seen by everybody interested in our products. What a fantastic achievement in these crazy times.

I'm still fighting with a couple of things.

- my 3D Printer drives me crazy (filament clogged the extruder, and I didn't have the Teflon tube I needed to replace)
- working on some authentication-related issues for the CSDK, and it moves slow and brought up some obstacles along the way that makes the implementation more expensive. I think that I found a solution that I need to finalize

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to my trip to Germany this Saturday. Not that Germany is the best place to travel right now, but I want to be there for my little daughter's birthday. And that's important to me.

A good friend shared this lovely video a couple of days ago. I like the way it's animated and narrated.
