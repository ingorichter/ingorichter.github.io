## WFH Day 197

We are getting close to the 200-day mark for work at home. Not necessarily something to celebrate, but a noticeable milestone during these times and a sign that every prediction how long this situation is supposed to last was wrong.
Only a couple of weeks left before the election, and tonight is the first debate between both presidential candidates. To protect my sanity, I'll watch the debate only for 15 mins max. That debate will be a battle that I can't stand.

One Highlight these days: The [Oakland Athletics](https://www.mlb.com/athletics) made it to the Playoffs! That is great, and I hope that after the rocky start today, that they will be more successful tomorrow in game #2.
