## WFH Day 329

A new year, and still, we are mostly trapped and confined in our homes without much todo. The days seem to follow the same pattern day in, day out. I went back to exercise more, not to feel brain tired, and have something accomplished with my body.

Anyway, that's not what I wanted to write. It was only something that came to my mind before I come to what I started two days ago: making a Sourdough starter. Yes, I could grab a batch of the over 100! year-old sourdough starter a friend of mine offered me before Christmas last year. Since I was traveling to Germany, I didn't know who can take care of the sourdough starter. So I declined, and upon returning to the US, I remembered that article I read in April 2020 when everybody was getting into making their sourdough bread.
And here we go. I followed the [instructions](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/wildsourdough/) and set up my starter.

I used this Flour that I still had in my kitchen cabinet. The Flour is nothing special. It's from Costco, and I bought it last year after everybody got crazy about hoarding food.

Let's see how this experiment turns out. Perhaps I can make some bread towards the end of February.
