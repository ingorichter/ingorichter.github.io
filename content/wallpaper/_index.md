title = "My Wallpaper Photo of the Week"
+++

Every Monday, I’ll post the photo that will be my desktop background for one week. I’ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken, and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by me. I’ll release them in the highest available quality. If you like a photo, you can download it for your personal use. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and the year.
