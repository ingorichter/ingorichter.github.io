title = "my wallpaper photo of the week"
+++

Every Monday, I’ll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week. I’ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by myself. I’ll release them in the highest availble quality. If you like a photo, you can download it for your personal use. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and year.
