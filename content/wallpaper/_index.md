When I feel it's time for a new desktop background, I’ll post the photo that will be my desktop background for the next few weeks. I’ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken, and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by me. I’ll release them in the highest available quality. If you like a photo, you can download it for your personal use. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and the year.
