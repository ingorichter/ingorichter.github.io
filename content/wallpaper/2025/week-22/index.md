## Wallpaper Week 22/2025

### Howdy

I've spent last Saturday afternoon riding my bicycle in a bigger loop in the East Bay. For a water and coffee break, I stopped on [Alameda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_(island)). The coffee shop was close to the beach, and I took the opportunity to find a spot on the beach to take some pictures of the bay and San Francisco in the far distance. Since the city was covered in afternoon fog, the whole scenery looked slightly apocalyptic with the sunset happening to the west of San Francisco.

You can see a lot of people on the beach with their tents, umbrellas, and canopies.
What I found interesting is the capsized sailing boat to the right side of the image. I don't know what happened to the boat, but it looks bizarre that this boat is sitting on the beach next to all the people enjoying their Sunday afternoon.

### About the Image

The image was taken with my [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/ "iPhone 16 Pro Max").

I used [Adobe Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com) 8.3.1 to sharpen, crop, and increase the contrast of the image to bring out the gloominess of the late afternoon.

BTW: don't ask me what happened to the __Focal Length__ in the Shot Details :-)
