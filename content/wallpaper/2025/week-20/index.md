## Wallpaper Week 20/2025

### Howdy

I went for a short hike last weekend in [Marin County, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County%2C_California "Marin County"). We had beautiful weather with temperatures around 70¬∞F and a light breeze that helped during the midday hike.

The hike from the parking lot was roughly 1.8 miles and mostly flat. There were other trails going higher over the mountain ridge, but we were not in the mood for climbing.

Once we arrived at the beach, there were a few people spread out across it. This is not a sandy beach; it has small pebbles that sting slightly when you walk barefoot across them. I dipped my legs into the ocean. It was cold‚Äîreally cold‚Äîbut the Pacific here in the north is always cold, no matter the time of year. It's refreshing and tolerable for a short moment.

The beach is in a little cove. To the left and right, you can see large rocks in a beautiful reddish color. The photo shows the view toward the north end of the cove. The woman in the picture clearly had more patience and enjoyed the cold water surrounding her legs.

I was happy to lie down on a blanket and enjoy the sun and the waves crashing on the beach. California ‚ù§Ô∏è at its best.

### About the Image

The image was taken with my [iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-16-pro/ "iPhone 16 Pro Max").

I used Adobe Lightroom 8.3.1 to sharpen, crop, and increase the contrast of the image.
