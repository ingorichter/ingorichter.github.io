## Wallpaper Week 04/2017

### About the Image

Happy Monday!

This week, I have again a photo from Santa Cruz, CA. I’ve taken this photo on 01/15/2017, during my Sunday trip to the beach. The image was taken with a [Sony Alpha A7II](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7m2-body-kit "Sony Alpha A7II") and the 28-70 mm Lens (70mm, f/9, 1⁄200, ISO 100).

The photo was slightly rotated to have straight vertical lines. I used the Lightroom Blue Hi-Contrast Filter for B/W conversion.
