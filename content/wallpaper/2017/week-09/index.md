## Wallpaper Week 09/2017

## Howdy

New York February 2005. I arrived in New York for a weekend stop over on the way to San Francisco. I wanted to visit the [The Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gates "The Gates") in [Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park "Central Park").

I was hoping for some snow during the night and some sun for Saturday morning. I wanted to capture the glowing orange fabric surrounded by the bright white environment. When I woke up Saturday morning, I was surprised to see that both wishes had come true. There was sun and snow! Awesome.

### About the Image

The image was taken with a [Canon EOS 10D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_10D "Canon EOS 10D") and the [Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8 SP XR Di LD Aspherical](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/284399-REG/Tamron_AF09C700_28_75mm_f_2_8_XR_Di.html "Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8 SP XR Di LD Aspherical") (28mm, f/6.7, 1‚ÅÑ250, ISO 100).

I used Adobe Lightroom 6.8 to sharpen, crop and increase the contrast of the image. I reduced the saturation for all colors except orange.
