## Wallpaper Week 08/2017

## Howdy

I spent last Weekend in [Yosemite, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite "Yosemite National Park"). It was a birthday present that my wife gave me. No children, away from home and time to attend a photography class in Yosemite. The class was organized from the Ansel Adams Gallery.

The class was 4 hours long and I took a lot of shots during the class. It was a lot of experimentation with the camera. How to deal with over-exposure, composition, color, white balancing, experiments with aperture priority, etc.

The photo was taken outside the national park. On the way to Yosemite Valley, I stopped on this little bridge. I went down to the river and tried several things with the camera. I enjoyed the white noise of the rushing river. Then I discovered the stone pyramid that somebody left behind. I like those pyramids. They look fragile and solid at the same time. And it seems, that the recent storms didn't do any harm to it.

### About the Image

The image was taken with a [Sony Alpha A7RII](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm2 "Sony Alpha A7RII") and the [FE 24-70mm F4 ZA O](https://www.zeiss.com/camera-lenses/en_us/camera_lenses/csc/variotessartfe42470za.html "FE 24-70mm F4 ZA OS") (25mm, f/4.0, 1‚ÅÑ60, ISO 4000).

I used Adobe Lightroom 6.8 to sharpen, crop and increase the contrast of the image.
