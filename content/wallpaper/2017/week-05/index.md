### About the Image

As you can see: I love [Santa Cruz](http://www.santacruz.org/)!.
This photo was taken on 02/14/2016. I spent the long weekend with my family in Santa Cruz. We stayed close to that beautiful beach and spent the afternoon in the sun.

The image was taken with a [Sony Alpha A7II](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7m2-body-kit "Sony Alpha A7II") and the 28-70 mm Lens (53mm, f/9, 1‚ÅÑ250, ISO 100).

I used Lightroom to crop the image a little bit. I made some adjustements on the white balance and bumped the sharpness slightly up.
