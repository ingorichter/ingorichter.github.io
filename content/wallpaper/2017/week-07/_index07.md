## Wallpaper Week 07/2017

## Howdy

I spent last Tuesday in San Jose, CA at the bi-annual Adobe developer conference that took place in the [San Jose Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Convention_Center "San Jose Convention Center").
The evening of the second day usually ends with the TechFair. Teams are showing off what they are working on. That's the most interesting part of the whole conference. You get some ideas about what is going on in the company and where we are heading.
The whole decoration for the venue was using glow sticks all over the place. People wore them, some large glow sticks were hanging from the ceiling.

### About the Image

The image was taken with a [Sony Alpha A7RII](https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm2 "Sony Alpha A7RII") and the [FE 24-70mm F4 ZA O](https://www.zeiss.com/camera-lenses/en_us/camera_lenses/csc/variotessartfe42470za.html "FE 24-70mm F4 ZA OS") (25mm, f/4.0, 1‚ÅÑ60, ISO 4000).

I used Adobe Lightroom 6.8 to sharpen the image and reduce some luminance noise.
