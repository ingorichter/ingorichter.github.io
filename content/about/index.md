I’m a software engineer with a passion for building high-quality software that puts users first. With over 20 years of experience in software development—spanning commercial and open-source projects—I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions.

Currently, I’m a Senior Computer Scientist at Adobe, working on a TypeScript Analytics SDK for internal use. Previously, I contributed to ShareSheet, [Adobe Experience Design CC (Adobe XD)](https://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html>), Photoshop Device Preview, and open-source projects like [Brackets](https://brackets.io") and [TabWrangler](https://github.com/tabwrangler/tabwrangler).

As a Certified Scrum Master with nearly a decade of hands-on experience, I believe in agile methodologies, process automation, and test automation as the backbone of high-quality software.

When I’m not coding, I spend time experimenting with 3D printing, laser cutting, and pen plotting. I also enjoy cycling, photography, and, of course, great coffee.

Want to connect? Let’s talk about software, automation, or just good coffee!
