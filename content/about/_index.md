I’m a software engineer with a vast experience in developing and shipping software with a strong focus on customer requirements, usability, and quality. I’m working with agile teams to deliver exceptionally high-quality software that adds value to the customer.

I’m a certified Scrum Master with nearly eight years of experience in practicing it.

I have a background in software development, and I’m involved in the creation of commercial software and open source for over 20 years.
I’m a firm believer in process automation. Test automation is my support system to deliver great software.

I love creating software, and I’m thrilled to be able to work on it full time and then some. When not coding, I regularly ride my bicycle, take photos, or drink great coffee.
