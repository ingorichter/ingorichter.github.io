I’m a software engineer with vast experience in developing and shipping software with a strong focus on customer demands, usability, and quality. I’m working with agile teams to deliver exceptionally high-quality software that adds value to the customer.

I’m a certified Scrum Master with nearly ten years of experience in practicing it.

I have a background in software development, and I have created commercial software and open source for over 20 years. I’m a firm believer in process automation. Test automation is my support system to deliver great software.

I love creating software, and I’m thrilled to work on it full-time and then some. When not coding, I regularly ride my bicycle, take photos, use my laser cutter and 3D printer, or drink great coffee.

I'm a senior computer scientist at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com), working on the iOS CreativeSDK used by millions of users. Previous projects I worked on in no specific order:[Adobe Experience Design CC (Adobe XD)](https://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html>) and Adobe Photoshop Device Preview. I contributed to [Brackets](https://brackets.io") and [TabWrangler](https://github.com/tabwrangler/tabwrangler).
