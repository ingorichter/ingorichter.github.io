He wanted to have something to place his new (and expensive) tamper for ground coffee. I always wanted to design and print something useful on my 3D Printer. And I wanted to learn and use OpenSCAD for a long time. Now I had an excellent reason to learn it.
Create the Design I had no experience with OpenSCAD at all when I started this little project.</description></item><item><title>Learning Crystal With Genetic Algorithms</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/learning-crystal-with-genetic-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2019 23:12:52 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/learning-crystal-with-genetic-algorithms/</guid><description>I like to learn new tools, programming languages, and exciting topics. I recently found the book Genetic Algorithms in Java Basics , and I found the code samples easy enough to understand to &amp;ldquo;translate&amp;rdquo; them to a different programming language for the sole purpose of getting some hands-on experience with a new programming language. I&amp;rsquo;m done with the 2nd chapter of the book and implemented the genetic algorithm described in that chapter to crystal lang.</description></item><item><title>Testing raw DOM Event Handler in Reactjs</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/testing-dom-event-handler-in-reactjs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 16:38:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/testing-dom-event-handler-in-reactjs/</guid><description>This is a reminder to myself. And to anybody who needs a creative solution to test an event handler directly attached to a DOM node of a react component.
Last Friday I ran into the situation to test my react component to ensure that the state updates correctly when the pointerenter and pointerleave event fires. Testing for these events is usually no big deal when you use reactjs in one way or the other (either web or native).</description></item><item><title>ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs_meetup_zendesk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2018 10:15:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs_meetup_zendesk/</guid><description>ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk Thursday night I attended the SF ReactJS Meetup at Zendesk.
First of all, there were some noticeable difference to some other meetups I went to in the past,
No need to sign No need to sign an NDA before entering the premise No Pizza! The office space is gorgeous. Grass on the wall, stairs to sit on and a small atrium like opening from the basement to the first floor to bring some light to the lower level.</description></item><item><title>Resize APFS Container in macOS 10.13 VMWare Image</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-resize-apfs-container-in-macos-10.13-vmware-image/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 22:45:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-resize-apfs-container-in-macos-10.13-vmware-image/</guid><description>Resize VMWare Disk size VMWare provides an option to resize the Hard disk of a VM. The Settings dialog provides this option under Hard Disk. If the VM is not running and you don&amp;rsquo;t have a snapshot, the slider is enabled, and you can size the disk to your desired size.
I wanted to increase the size of the hard disk from 50 GB to 100 GB. That&amp;rsquo;s a matter of seconds, and I was ready to go.</description></item><item><title>Effective Git - Worktrees</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/effective-git-worktrees/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 21:19:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/effective-git-worktrees/</guid><description>You know this situation: you are working on new feature branch of your product. A bunch of files has been changed, nothing has settled yet and lots of uncommitted changes. This is how work in progress looks like. Everything could be alright, but then you are asked to check out that high priority issue that a customer reported.
What I did in this situation
stash my changes with git stash save and provide a meaningful message for when I have to unstash- my changes changes branches and pull from master build the product repro the issue create a new branch for the fix implement the fix and push to the newly created branch let somebody else verify the fix go back to my previous branch git stash pop my work in progress continue working on the feature Introducing Worktrees I was reading git release notes, and I stumbled upon something I haven’t heard before in the git context: worktree.</description></item><item><title>Efficient JavaScript Unit Testing with Jest and Snapshots</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/efficient-unit-testing-with-jest-and-snapshots/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 11:55:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/efficient-unit-testing-with-jest-and-snapshots/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a bold statement:
We all love to write unit great tests for our code. More or less.
— Unknown Programmer
Writing unit tests for my code mostly follows this pattern
Write a test and make it fail (red) Write the function to fix the test (implement function) Start over with step 1 For one of my projects, I was using jest. It&amp;rsquo;s fast now, and it has several features that I highly value.</description></item><item><title>My Wallpaper Photo of the Week</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 23:30:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</guid><description>My Wallpaper Photo of the Week Every Monday, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week.

If you use a Unix based operating system, then you will be able to send any process a signal. This might be either Ctrl+C or SIGINT to interrupt that process. Or you can send SIGINFO to report the progress of it&amp;#8217;s operation. Why this is awesome? Did you ever copy a huge amount of data and cp didn&amp;#8217;t tell you how much has data has been copied so far?</description></item><item><title>Don't say it.

Don’t overthink everything.
Don’t make it more complicated than it has to be.
Don’t stop learning.
Don’t stop trying.
Try harder.
Try smarter.
Don’t say “it’s impossible”.
Move faster.
Do it!</description></item><item><title>TIL - Reactjs optimization that cost me some time</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs-optimizations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 23:15:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs-optimizations/</guid><description>I was building a Reactjs component, that should toggle between two child components.
&amp;lt;Toggle&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Comp1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Comp2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Toggle&amp;gt; The render method of Toggle looked like this
render() { const content = React.Children.count(this.props.children) &amp;gt; 0 ? this.props.children[0] : this.props.children[1]; return ( ${content} ); } Unfortunately, this didn&amp;#8217;t work (index out of bounds), when I passed only one component instead of two. This doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense since the Toggle is supposed to toggle between two components.</description></item><item><title>TIL - where to put ant-contrib</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-where-to-put-ant-contrib/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2016 20:15:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-where-to-put-ant-contrib/</guid><description>I was testing an ant based build script change today. And I thought ant was already retired.
Running the script led to a lot of warnings about a missing library. I asked the person, if there are any dependencies for ant-contrib. His response was "yes, you need to install ant-contrib".
First of all, I didn&amp;#8217;t have ant installed. But that was easy with
irichter@irichter-MacBookPro:~ brew install ant Unfortunately, ant-contrib wasn&amp;#8217;t available via homebrew, so I had to download it and place it&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; where?</description></item><item><title>Welcome to my new blog presence</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/welcome-to-my-new-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 18:49:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/welcome-to-my-new-blog/</guid><description>After a long time, I&amp;#8217;m finally moving my blog to this new github hosted location. Cleaner setup, easier to maintain and independent from any content management system.
This will be home to all new posts in the future. There will be tweaks to the setup and layout in the next couple of days. It&amp;#8217;s not perfect yet, but I wanted to get it going. The blog will be available under this domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
