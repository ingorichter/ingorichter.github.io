&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders" title="JankyBorders">JankyBorders&lt;/a> is a tool that allows you to add a colored border around macOS app windows. This is helpful, especially in dark mode, to better see the window border and identify which application window is in front and active.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a simple configuration file, it’s possible to specify the colors for the active and inactive windows. The program has more customizable options than I will discuss here. I focus on defining the colors for the active window and the inactive windows. I will also show how to use gradients and glow for borders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Learn New Things</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2024/how-to-learn-new-things/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 21:54:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2024/how-to-learn-new-things/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Losing Weight and Improve My Health</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2024/losing-weight-and-improve-my-health/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 22:38:52 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2024/losing-weight-and-improve-my-health/</guid><description/></item><item><title>US Citizenship</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/us-citizenship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/us-citizenship/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="im-a-us-citizen-now---">I&amp;rsquo;m a US Citizen Now 🇩🇪 + 🇺🇸&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On July 31, 2023, I received my US Citizenship certificate during the Oath Ceremony at the USCIS Field Office in San Francisco. The whole process from filing BBG to certificate took ~22 Months. There was a delay in the biometrics appointment since I was in Germany for a more extended period. I now have German and US Citizenship and can freely roam between countries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It Is Already May</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/it-is-already-may/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/it-is-already-may/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="its-already-may">It&amp;rsquo;s already May&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Woah, we have already surpassed the four-month mark for this year. A lot of things have happened in the last four months.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>In January, I was reassigned to my new team. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m working on our products&amp;rsquo; &lt;em>Share and Review&lt;/em> functionality. I&amp;rsquo;m back to Web Development + plus a little bit of &lt;a href="https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/" title="UXP">UXP&lt;/a> (proprietary Tech) that enables us to target our Desktop Apps with the same JS/TS code base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spent 40 days in Germany from March through Easter in April. My son&amp;rsquo;s exchange partner from Ireland stayed with us for three weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In February, I applied for US citizenship. Unfortunately, I had to cancel three biometrics submission appointments because I was in Germany and didn&amp;rsquo;t expect USCIS to ask so quickly to appear in person. Now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything from USCIS for a month. I assume that they put me at the end of the queue. Sigh&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A friend passed away after some long struggle in March. Rest in Peace, Peter 🥲. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After two years of waiting for my invitation to order the new &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/?gnav=header-electrified-vhp" title="Ford F-150 Lightning">Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a> truck, it&amp;rsquo;s now my turn. I have time to decide until 5/8/2023 if I want to order it. After waiting a long time, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s an appropriate car for me. I like the idea of having an electric truck. It seemed the best way to justify such a big, unreasonable car. Given the state of competition in the EV market space and the crazy price hike for the F-150 since its introduction, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I feel excited about buying this truck. And then, there are rumors about technical issues with the F-150 that would delay the delivery by several months. No, thank you. Anyway, it was an exciting idea and something that kept me dreaming&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started to exercise daily. Mobility and strength exercises to prevent problems with my body. I had a back issue last summer that lasted nearly six months. They only went away after some severe mobility and stretching exercise. I got a copy of &lt;a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL39377234M" title="Built To Move">Built to Move&lt;/a>. The book talks about the importance of keeping the body moving.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. I hope the weather will improve in the coming weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s frigid and rainy for this time of year. One of the positives of the weather situation is that the wildfires are probably pushed out later this year 🤞🏼 I hope the best that the wildfire season doesn&amp;rsquo;t get so crazy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dayjs Extension Usage</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/dayjs-extension-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/dayjs-extension-usage/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="enable-extensions-for-dayjs">Enable extensions for dayjs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was working on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ingorichter/Biorhythm">small project&lt;/a> to sharpen my Javascript and Typescript skills. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project deals with data calculations, and I was looking for a modern replacement of momentjs. I found &lt;a href="https://day.js.org/en/">dayjs&lt;/a>, which seemed to be a suitable replacement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned, I had to find the number of days between the two dates. The documentation of dayjs mentioned a method to calculate the difference between two dates as duration. The duration could then be represented as days. That is exactly what I needed for my calculations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kicking Nextcloud Cron Script from TrueNAS Cron Job</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/kicking-nextcloud-cron-script-from-truenas-cronjob/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/kicking-nextcloud-cron-script-from-truenas-cronjob/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="kicking-nextcloud-cron-script-from-truenas-cron-job">Kicking Nextcloud Cron Script from TrueNAS Cron Job&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>I was never an active user of Twitter. Occasionally, I was browsing my feed. I follow the #genart posts and read about technology. My occasional post about some lesser important topic, the link to a blog post I wrote, or a retweet about something I believed to be interesting. I never ended up in a heated discussion about any crap with random people. I have a pretty dull social media existence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the Way to Dual Citizenship (🇩🇪🇺🇸)</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/on-the-way-to-dual-citizenship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/on-the-way-to-dual-citizenship/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="13-months">13 Months&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2>

I found an update to the fan shroud that looked very efficient, and somebody analyzed the airflow, and it appeared to be very effective in cooling the filament.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Friday Evening Source Code Changes</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/friday-evening-source-code-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/friday-evening-source-code-changes/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="well-crap-what-a-waste-of-time">Well, Crap, what a waste of time&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>But, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday evening, after our social team meeting, and I am still excited to finish something substantial for this feature that I&amp;rsquo;m working. Lots of moving parts, refactored code, loose ends, and hastily glued together code without any safety net. A couple of new unit tests for the new feature and some legacy code that I have to touch. Very picky and sensible legacy code. I&amp;rsquo;m careful not to break any existing and battlefield-proven code that is used by ~25M monthly active users across multiple products. Run the existing unit tests between more considerable changes and ensure that it stays in the green.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3d Printed Axidraw Easel Spacer</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/3d-printed-axidraw-easel-spacer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/3d-printed-axidraw-easel-spacer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="designing-a-spacer-for-my-axidraw-plotter">Designing a Spacer for my AxiDraw Plotter&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Adding Swift Code to Objective-C Project&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ensure your Swift class derives direct or indirect from NSObject&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure your Swift class is &lt;code>public&lt;/code> to ensure the &lt;code>YourProjectName-Swift.h&lt;/code> header generation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prefix the class to expose it to Objective-C. Any Property or method needs its own &lt;code>@objc&lt;/code> annotation to be visible from Objective-C.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use the &lt;code>@objcMembers&lt;/code> annotation to expose all properties and methods of the Swift class&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="reminder-for-myself">Reminder for myself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I learned a couple of essential things about mixing Objective-C and Swift in one project.
I was using Swift for unit tests already, and that worked fine.
Now, I wanted to implement a new class in Swift. But I wanted to use that class in an existing Objective-C class.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding Multiple Files to Macos Gatekeeper</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/adding-multiple-files-to-macos-gatekeeper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/adding-multiple-files-to-macos-gatekeeper/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-gatekeeper">The Gatekeeper&lt;/h2>

But if you want to execute an open-source tool installed by &lt;a href="https://brew.sh">brew&lt;/a> or some other way on your machine, you will usually see something like this confirmation dialog.

&lt;p>I briefly started to use SwiftUI in 2021. I wanted to learn about the fundamentals and how SwiftUI differs from the traditional iOS and macOS development frameworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the next couple of weeks, I will provide tutorials to help others learn SwiftUI by building some apps. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start building a Minesweeper clone. Minesweeper is a simple game that I loved to play when it was released with Windows 3.1 in 1990. The game idea itself is older, according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game">Wikipedia&lt;/a>.
Building it for iOS and macOS is a great way to use SwiftUI and share code among both platforms. And creating an old game on a modern platform seemed to be a great exercise. Learning how to make something look like a Windows Program on macOS and iOS seemed like a fun way to learn UI styling and bend code to your will.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Thanksgiving 🦃</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/happy-thanksgiving/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/happy-thanksgiving/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="happy-thanksgiving">Happy Thanksgiving&lt;/h2>

Testing for these events is usually no big deal when you use reactjs in one way or the other (either web or native).

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Write a test and make it fail (red)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write the function to fix the test (implement function)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start over with step 1&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For one of my projects, I was using &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">jest&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s fast now, and it has several features that I highly value. Most of them integrated code coverage and Snapshot testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Wallpaper Photo of the Week</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 23:30:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week">My Wallpaper Photo of the Week&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every Monday, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by myself. I&amp;rsquo;ll release them in the highest availble quality. If you like a photo, you can &lt;strong>download it for your personal use&lt;/strong>. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get Up And Start Walking</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/get-up-and-start-walking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2016 11:55:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/get-up-and-start-walking/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="get-up-and-start-walking">Get Up And Start Walking&lt;/h1>

If you want something you never had, then do something you never did.

&lt;p>When I heard the above quote for the first time, it was eye opening to me. Why? It expresses very clearly to me, that you need to get active, if you want to reach a goal in your life. No matter what it is. Get a promotion, earn more money, hike the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail%5BPacific">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail[Pacific&lt;/a> Crest Trail].

&lt;p>Today I learnt something really awesome. If you use a Unix based operating system, then you will be able to send any process a signal. This might be either &lt;code>Ctrl+C&lt;/code> or &lt;strong>SIGINT&lt;/strong> to interrupt that process. Or you can send &lt;strong>SIGINFO&lt;/strong> to report the progress of it&amp;rsquo;s operation. Why this is awesome? Did you ever copy a huge amount of data and &lt;code>cp&lt;/code> didn&amp;rsquo;t tell you how much has data has been copied so far? &lt;strong>SIGINT&lt;/strong> to the rescue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't say it.

Cleaner setup, easier to maintain and independent from any content management system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will be home to all new posts in the future. There will be tweaks to the setup and layout in the next couple of days. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect yet, but I wanted to get it going.
The blog will be available under this &lt;a href="https://ingo-richter.io">domain&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
