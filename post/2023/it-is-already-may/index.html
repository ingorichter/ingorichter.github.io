Woah, we have already surpassed the four-month mark for this year. A lot of things have happened in the last four months.

In January, I was reassigned to my new team. Now, I&rsquo;m working on our products&rsquo; Share and Review functionality. I&rsquo;m back to Web Development + plus a little bit of UXP (proprietary Tech) that enables us to target our Desktop Apps with the same JS/TS code base
Spent 40 days in Germany from March through Easter in April. My son&rsquo;s exchange partner from Ireland stayed with us for three weeks
In February, I applied for US citizenship. Unfortunately, I had to cancel three biometrics submission appointments because I was in Germany and didn&rsquo;t expect USCIS to ask so quickly to appear in person. Now, I haven&rsquo;t heard anything from USCIS for a month. I assume that they put me at the end of the queue. Sigh&mldr;
A friend passed away after some long struggle in March. Rest in Peace, Peter 🥲. I&rsquo;ll never forget you
After two years of waiting for my invitation to order the new Ford F-150 Lightning truck, it&rsquo;s now my turn. I have time to decide until 5/8/2023 if I want to order it. After waiting a long time, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an appropriate car for me. I like the idea of having an electric truck. It seemed the best way to justify such a big, unreasonable car. Given the state of competition in the EV market space and the crazy price hike for the F-150 since its introduction, I don&rsquo;t think I feel excited about buying this truck. And then, there are rumors about technical issues with the F-150 that would delay the delivery by several months. No, thank you. Anyway, it was an exciting idea and something that kept me dreaming
I started to exercise daily. Mobility and strength exercises to prevent problems with my body. I had a back issue last summer that lasted nearly six months. They only went away after some severe mobility and stretching exercise. I got a copy of Built to Move. The book talks about the importance of keeping the body moving.

That&rsquo;s all for now. I hope the weather will improve in the coming weeks. It&rsquo;s frigid and rainy for this time of year. One of the positives of the weather situation is that the wildfires are probably pushed out later this year 🤞🏼 I hope the best that the wildfire season doesn&rsquo;t get so crazy."><meta name=keywords content="Life,Update,Progress,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/it-is-already-may/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="It Is Already May"><meta property="og:description" content="It’s already May Woah, we have already surpassed the four-month mark for this year.
