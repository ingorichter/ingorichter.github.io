I was working on a small project to sharpen my Javascript and Typescript skills. Nothing fancy.
The project deals with data calculations, and I was looking for a modern replacement of momentjs. I found dayjs, which seemed to be a suitable replacement.
As I mentioned, I had to find the number of days between the two dates. The documentation of dayjs mentioned a method to calculate the difference between two dates as duration. The duration could then be represented as days. That is exactly what I needed for my calculations."><meta name=keywords content="TIL,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/dayjs-extension-usage/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Dayjs Extension Usage"><meta property="og:description" content="Enable extensions for dayjs I was working on a small project to sharpen my Javascript and Typescript skills.

But that still didn&rsquo;t work. <code>duration</code> was still undefined.
I missed a crucial part in the documentation (perhaps I was too tired or impatient), but the most crucial part to add those additional methods to dayjs is to call <code>dayjs.extend(duration);</code>. This call to <code>extend</code> will make the methods and properties available on the dayjs object.</p><p>Lesson learnt: RTFM!
