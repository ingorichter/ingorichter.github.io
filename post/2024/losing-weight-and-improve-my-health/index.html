</content><content><h2 id=tldr>TL;DR</h2><p>I had some health issues at the end of 2023 that negatively impacted my quality of life. I had numerous doctor visits, and after several tests, the issue was diagnosed, and I received treatment. I&rsquo;m feeling much better now. One thing the doctor ordered me to do is to lose weight - a lot of weight (~70 lbs) - and it should happen quickly. Another motivation to lose weight is to look better in my son&rsquo;s graduation pictures in May. When he graduated from high school five years ago, I was shocked looking at the pictures. I felt bad about my appearance, and I don&rsquo;t want to have that feeling again.</p><h3 id=where-to-start>Where to start?</h3><p>The doctors&rsquo;s recommendation was essentially to stop eating and start the day hungry and go to bed hungry. In other words, stop eating and live with a massive caloric deficit to lose weight. I don&rsquo;t believe in starvation diets. Your body goes into defense mode and tries to protect as much of the available energy. It&rsquo;s a silly and dangerous idea.</p><h3 id=3-week-fasting>3 week fasting</h3><p>A friend of my wife gave me a plan for a three-week fast. This involved cutting down caloric intake to a bare minimum. It was challenging in the first couple of days, but I have some intermittent fasting experience, and it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p><h3 id=how-it-worked-out>How it worked out</h3><p>I started on 01/23/24 with roughly 278 lbs and finished on 2/12/24 with 259 lbs. I lost 19 lbs, and I&rsquo;m proud of it. Most importantly, the amount of body fat was reduced by 6.1 lbs, and my muscle mass stayed the same. That is good. I was exercising every other day. Nothing crazy for now. Rowing machine for 10 mins, then kettlebell training for 15-20 mins. And I have a daily goal to walk 1.5 miles. And on most days, I was able to do it.</p><p>Some days, I craved certain foods. Not candy or sweets. Veggie broth, yogurt, cottage cheese, tea, coffee, and a small allowed selection of fruit and veggies didn&rsquo;t seem appealing to me on some days. Then I noticed an interesting pattern: feeling bored, desperate, procrastinating, etc. I would go into the kitchen to look for something that I could eat. The problem was that I wasn&rsquo;t hungry. It was only a way to satisfy any of the feelings that crept up. It seemed to me that I was compensating for those feelings with food. It would usually provide comfort, but not during this 3-week fast. I am prone to fall back into this trap once the weeks are over. I guess that is some sort of human weakness that I have to accept or find a solution.</p><h3 id=and-what-is-the-plan-moving-forward>And what is the plan moving forward</h3><p>Now, it&rsquo;s about reducing my weight further. In small steps with better eating habits. That entails not eating too late in the evening. I&rsquo;m trying to use 7 pm as the cutoff time. My other change will be to exercise at least 4 times per week. This will combine strength training and endurance training.</p><p>I signed up for the fun <a href=https://baytobreakers.com>Bay to Breakers</a> on May 19th, 2024. I have not attended this event since 2017. This will be fun and I have a plan to exclusively exercise for this event in the upcoming weeks. The good thing about having to exercise with a goal in mind is that it keeps me motivated.</p><p>I&rsquo;m motivated to stay active and to change my eating habits. In general, I&rsquo;m eating less food than at the beginning of the year. That is great. I want to see faster results when it comes to weight loss, but I&rsquo;m aware of the fact that the weight didn&rsquo;t come overnight, and getting rid of it will take some time. So, small progress is progress too. I always have to remind myself about it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a journey, and I&rsquo;ll go this way further. I can do it.</p></content><p><a href=/blog/health/>#Health</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//ingorichterio.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></main><footer><span>© 2025 Ingo Richter</span>
