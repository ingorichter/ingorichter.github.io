I briefly started to use SwiftUI in 2021. I wanted to learn about the fundamentals and how SwiftUI differs from the traditional iOS and macOS development frameworks.
Over the next couple of weeks, I will provide tutorials to help others learn SwiftUI by building some apps. I&rsquo;m going to start building a Minesweeper clone. Minesweeper is a simple game that I loved to play when it was released with Windows 3.1 in 1990. The game idea itself is older, according to Wikipedia.
Building it for iOS and macOS is a great way to use SwiftUI and share code among both platforms. And creating an old game on a modern platform seemed to be a great exercise. Learning how to make something look like a Windows Program on macOS and iOS seemed like a fun way to learn UI styling and bend code to your will."><meta name=keywords content="TIL,swiftui,learning,tutorial,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/swiftui---learn-by-doing/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Swiftui   Learn by Doing"><meta property="og:description" content="SwiftUI - Learn by doing I briefly started to use SwiftUI in 2021.
