Ah, in the <code>lib</code> folder of your <a href=https://ant.apache.org/>ant</a> installation. Okay, that might one solution. I remembered, that years ago I was using it in a different way. There was another location where ant was looking for additional jars.</p><h2 id=this-worked-for-me>This worked for me</h2><ul><li>create or locate the <code>~/.ant/lib</code> directory</li><li>copy all additional jars in this directory</li></ul><p>From now on, <a href=https://ant.apache.org/>ant</a> will be able to find <a href=http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/>ant-contrib</a> and I don&rsquo;t have to mess around with the <a href=https://ant.apache.org/>ant</a> installation directory.
Clean, nice and simple solution.</p><p>NOTE: I don&rsquo;t know, if this will work on Windows in the same way.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p></content><p><a href=/blog/til/>#TIL</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
