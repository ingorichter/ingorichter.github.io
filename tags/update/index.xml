A lot of things have happened in the last four months.
In January, I was reassigned to my new team. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m working on our products&amp;rsquo; Share and Review functionality. I&amp;rsquo;m back to Web Development + plus a little bit of UXP (proprietary Tech) that enables us to target our Desktop Apps with the same JS/TS code base Spent 40 days in Germany from March through Easter in April.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to my new blog presence</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/welcome-to-my-new-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 18:49:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/welcome-to-my-new-blog/</guid><description>After a long time, I’m finally moving my blog to this new github hosted location. Cleaner setup, easier to maintain and independent from any content management system.
This will be home to all new posts in the future. There will be tweaks to the setup and layout in the next couple of days. It’s not perfect yet, but I wanted to get it going. The blog will be available under this domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
