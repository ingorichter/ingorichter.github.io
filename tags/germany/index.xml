Time flies like crazy, and we are in month 15 of the pandemic. It looks like the US is speeding up things a lot, and people get vaccinated in large quantities. I got my vaccine three weeks ago. This upcoming Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll receive my 2nd shot, and then I should be fully vaccinated two weeks later. The situation is not so great in Germany.</description></item></channel></rss>
