The whole process from filing BBG to certificate took ~22 Months. There was a delay in the biometrics appointment since I was in Germany for a more extended period. I now have German and US Citizenship and can freely roam between countries.</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 414</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day414/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day414/</guid><description>WFH Day 414 Unbelievable, but it&amp;rsquo;s already May of 2021! Time flies like crazy, and we are in month 15 of the pandemic. It looks like the US is speeding up things a lot, and people get vaccinated in large quantities. I got my vaccine three weeks ago. This upcoming Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll receive my 2nd shot, and then I should be fully vaccinated two weeks later. The situation is not so great in Germany.</description></item></channel></rss>
