Nothing fancy.
The project deals with data calculations, and I was looking for a modern replacement of momentjs. I found dayjs, which seemed to be a suitable replacement.
As I mentioned, I had to find the number of days between the two dates. The documentation of dayjs mentioned a method to calculate the difference between two dates as duration.</description></item><item><title>Kicking Nextcloud Cron Script from TrueNAS Cron Job</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/kicking-nextcloud-cron-script-from-truenas-cronjob/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2023/kicking-nextcloud-cron-script-from-truenas-cronjob/</guid><description>Kicking Nextcloud Cron Script from TrueNAS Cron Job Tl;DR I&amp;rsquo;m running TrueCharts Nextcloud in my TrueNAS SCALE at home. After the setup, I discovered that none of the cron jobs was running. I&amp;rsquo;m using the Nextcloud News App and never saw any new stories. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to make the Nextcloud cron work, so I decided to have a cron job that runs every hour to kick the Nextclodu cron job in the Nextcloud docker container.</description></item><item><title>Friday Evening Source Code Changes</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/friday-evening-source-code-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/friday-evening-source-code-changes/</guid><description>Well, Crap, what a waste of time One would guess that I should have known better with the work experience I accumulated in the software engineering field.
But, it&amp;rsquo;s Friday evening, after our social team meeting, and I am still excited to finish something substantial for this feature that I&amp;rsquo;m working. Lots of moving parts, refactored code, loose ends, and hastily glued together code without any safety net. A couple of new unit tests for the new feature and some legacy code that I have to touch.</description></item><item><title>3d Printed Axidraw Easel Spacer</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/3d-printed-axidraw-easel-spacer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/3d-printed-axidraw-easel-spacer/</guid><description>Designing a Spacer for my AxiDraw Plotter I have an AxiDraw V3/A3 Penplotter that I bought to satisfy a desire to own such a fantastic machine. It started in my teen years working with HP Plotters in our university lab at the TUHH. I could not afford an HP Plotter back in the day, so that desire was never satisfied.
Jumping forward to today: I bought the AxiDraw Plotter in the Summer of 2021, and I ordered the Magnetic Easel.</description></item><item><title>TIL - Adding Swift Code to Objective-C Project</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/til-adding-swift-code-to-objective-c-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/til-adding-swift-code-to-objective-c-project/</guid><description>TL;DR Adding Swift Code to Objective-C Project
Ensure your Swift class derives direct or indirect from NSObject Ensure your Swift class is public to ensure the YourProjectName-Swift.h header generation Prefix the class to expose it to Objective-C. Any Property or method needs its own @objc annotation to be visible from Objective-C. Use the @objcMembers annotation to expose all properties and methods of the Swift class Reminder for myself I learned a couple of essential things about mixing Objective-C and Swift in one project.</description></item><item><title>Adding Multiple Files to Macos Gatekeeper</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/adding-multiple-files-to-macos-gatekeeper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/adding-multiple-files-to-macos-gatekeeper/</guid><description>The Gatekeeper Before I forget what I learned today, I better write it down.
Gatekeeper on macOS ensures that properly signed and authentic apps and other executable files, including dylibs and kexts, are executed on your Mac. But if you want to execute an open-source tool installed by brew or some other way on your machine, you will usually see something like this confirmation dialog. In this case, for an app FSNotes installed with brew.</description></item><item><title>Hugo, Themes and My Theme Customization</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/hugo-themes-and-my-theme-customization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/hugo-themes-and-my-theme-customization/</guid><description>TL;DR Hugo&amp;rsquo;s file lookup magic was biting me and was causing the 3rd party template to use a file with the same name from my blog assets directory.

I wanted to learn about the fundamentals and how SwiftUI differs from the traditional iOS and macOS development frameworks.
Over the next couple of weeks, I will provide tutorials to help others learn SwiftUI by building some apps. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start building a Minesweeper clone. Minesweeper is a simple game that I loved to play when it was released with Windows 3.</description></item><item><title>TIL - Organize a Folder of Thousands of Images Into Subfolders</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/organize-a-folder-of-thousands-of-images-into-subfolders/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/organize-a-folder-of-thousands-of-images-into-subfolders/</guid><description>Reorg Time I use Nextclouds image upload feature to backup all photos from my phone. I recently discovered that you could upload pictures from your phone into subfolders in the YEAR/MONTH/DAY/picturefile format.
After switching this feature on, I realized that all my previously uploaded 3000+ images and short videos lie flat in the Pictures folder. I needed a solution to organize all existing photos into the same subfolder structure.
I was thinking about writing a shell script and using ExifTool to read the EXIF metadata and move the pictures into their respective folder location based on their creation date.</description></item><item><title>Resize APFS Container in macOS 10.13 VMWare Image</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-resize-apfs-container-in-macos-10.13-vmware-image/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 22:45:27 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-resize-apfs-container-in-macos-10.13-vmware-image/</guid><description>Resize VMWare Disk size VMWare provides an option to resize the Hard disk of a VM. The Settings dialog provides this option under Hard Disk. If the VM is not running and you don&amp;rsquo;t have a snapshot, the slider is enabled, and you can size the disk to your desired size.
I wanted to increase the size of the hard disk from 50 GB to 100 GB. That&amp;rsquo;s a matter of seconds, and I was ready to go.</description></item><item><title>Effective Git - Worktrees</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/effective-git---worktrees/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 21:19:27 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/effective-git---worktrees/</guid><description>You know this situation: you are working on new feature branch of your product. A bunch of files has been changed, nothing has settled yet and lots of uncommitted changes. This is how work in progress looks like. Everything could be alright, but then you are asked to check out that high priority issue that a customer reported.
What I did in this situation
stash my changes with git stash save and provide a meaningful message for when I have to unstash- my changes changes branches and pull from master build the product repro the issue create a new branch for the fix implement the fix and push to the newly created branch let somebody else verify the fix go back to my previous branch git stash pop my work in progress continue working on the feature Introducing Worktrees I was reading git release notes, and I stumbled upon something I haven’t heard before in the git context: worktree.</description></item><item><title>Efficient JavaScript Unit Testing with Jest and Snapshots</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/efficient-unit-testing-with-jest-and-snapshots/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 11:55:51 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/efficient-unit-testing-with-jest-and-snapshots/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a bold statement:
We all love to write unit great tests for our code. More or less.
— Unknown Programmer
Writing unit tests for my code mostly follows this pattern
Write a test and make it fail (red) Write the function to fix the test (implement function) Start over with step 1 For one of my projects, I was using jest. It&amp;rsquo;s fast now, and it has several features that I highly value.</description></item><item><title>TIL - Reactjs optimization that cost me some time</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs-optimizations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 23:15:51 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/reactjs-optimizations/</guid><description>I was building a Reactjs component, that should toggle between two child components.
&amp;lt;Toggle&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Comp1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Comp2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/Toggle&amp;gt; The render method of Toggle looked like this render() { const content = React.Children.count(this.props.children) &amp;gt; 0 ? this.props.children[0] : this.props.children[1]; return ( ${content} ); }
Unfortunately, this didn&amp;rsquo;t work (index out of bounds), when I passed only one component instead of two. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense since the Toggle is supposed to toggle between two components.</description></item><item><title>TIL - where to put ant-contrib</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-where-to-put-ant-contrib/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2016 20:15:51 -0700</pubDate><author>ingo@ingo-richter.io (Ingo Richter)</author><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/til-where-to-put-ant-contrib/</guid><description>I was testing an ant based build script change today. And I thought ant was already retired.
Running the script led to a lot of warnings about a missing library. I asked the person, if there are any dependencies for ant-contrib. His response was &amp;ldquo;yes, you need to install ant-contrib&amp;rdquo;.
First of all, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have ant installed. But that was easy with
irichter@irichter-MacBookPro:~ brew2 install ant Unfortunately, ant-contrib wasn&amp;rsquo;t available via homebrew, so I had to download it and place it&amp;hellip; where?</description></item></channel></rss>
