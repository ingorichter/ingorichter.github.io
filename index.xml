Every time I travel to Germany, it feels like it&amp;rsquo;ll take longer to recover. And this week, I had a lot of meetings and tons of work to finish our development sprint. Not great, but I punched through it.
Regarding the Jetlag: I tried many things to get back to my rhythm faster, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work well enough.</description></item><item><title>Hugo, Themes and My Theme Customization</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/hugo-themes-and-my-theme-customization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2022/hugo-themes-and-my-theme-customization/</guid><description>TL;DR Hugo&amp;rsquo;s file lookup magic was biting me and was causing the 3rd party template to use a file with the same name from my blog assets directory.

I wanted to learn about the fundamentals and how SwiftUI differs from the traditional iOS and macOS development frameworks.
Over the next couple of weeks, I will provide tutorials to help others learn SwiftUI by building some apps. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start building a Minesweeper clone. Minesweeper is a simple game that I loved to play when it was released with Windows 3.</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 657</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/01/day657/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/01/day657/</guid><description>WFH Day 657 Happy New Year!
I hope you all had a great party to start the new year. Let&amp;rsquo;s all hope that we stay healthy and safe given the uncertainty of the still ongoing pandemic.
New year, new beginnings. Everything is possible, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to some exciting times. I still have the company-provided sabbatical that I must take this year (it will expire otherwise). I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to traveling to Yosemite in February, Nashville in April, Germany in June.</description></item><item><title>Happy Thanksgiving 🦃</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/happy-thanksgiving/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2021/happy-thanksgiving/</guid><description>Happy Thanksgiving I wish everybody a great day with their families and friends.

Part of the time, I had some PTO and was able to meet with friends and family. The remaining time I was either working or renovating the new place for my wife.

I recently discovered that you could upload pictures from your phone into subfolders in the YEAR/MONTH/DAY/picturefile format.
After switching this feature on, I realized that all my previously uploaded 3000+ images and short videos lie flat in the Pictures folder. I needed a solution to organize all existing photos into the same subfolder structure.
I was thinking about writing a shell script and using ExifTool to read the EXIF metadata and move the pictures into their respective folder location based on their creation date.</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 438</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day438/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day438/</guid><description>WFH Day 438 I get it. We are all waiting for the pandemic to be over. Everybody wants their normal pre-pandemic life back. But will this be possible? What exactly do we mean by saying that? What do we consider normal life? Meeting with friends in person? Meeting anybody in person? Being able to leave your face mask at home? Getting rid of all the restrictions is probably the most important thing for many of us (it&amp;rsquo;s only a guess).</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 421</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/</guid><description>WFH Day 421 I got up this morning by 6 am, jumped into my running gear, and headed outside by 6:30 am for a short 2 miles run. It was exhausting, and I was slow. But what&amp;rsquo;s more important: I did it anyway! It took me 24m and 28s. Slow as hell, but I need to start somewhere to get better. This is a start.

Time flies like crazy, and we are in month 15 of the pandemic. It looks like the US is speeding up things a lot, and people get vaccinated in large quantities. I got my vaccine three weeks ago. This upcoming Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll receive my 2nd shot, and then I should be fully vaccinated two weeks later. The situation is not so great in Germany.</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 365</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day365/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day365/</guid><description>WFH Day 365 I took some time during the weekend to minimize my belongings. What does that mean? I got rid of some redundant electronics in the Garage. I threw out some old clothes that clogged my closet. I organized my 3D Printer setup and reduced duplicate tools, and put the wanted stuff in some boxes to keep some order. I trashed some boxes with stuff that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember made it during the move&amp;hellip; There is so much more to minimize.</description></item><item><title>Day353</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/</guid><description>WFH Day 353 I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep too bad last night. I got up at around 7:15 am, made myself a coffee, and continued to read my current book Gerta. I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t put time aside for reading, I will never finish any longer book in a finite amount of time. Reading in bed at night is something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly, and then my Kindle, or even worse, my iPad, falls to my face.</description></item><item><title>Day350</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</guid><description>WFH Day 350 It&amp;rsquo;s already the last day of a perfect month. Perfect in that sense that the month started with a Monday and ended adequately on a Sunday. :-)
I mentioned in my post that I was about to create my sourdough starter. It was an experiment, and I failed it.

Yesterday, they told me that they would get their vaccination today. I was amazed to hear that since my healthcare provider is sending me weekly updates about the actual vaccination progress and that they vaccinate people over 75. It looks like I still have to wait a bit longer since they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough vaccines for this age group.</description></item><item><title>Day329</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</guid><description>WFH Day 329 A new year, and still, we are mostly trapped and confined in our homes without much todo. The days seem to follow the same pattern day in, day out. I went back to exercise more, not to feel brain tired, and have something accomplished with my body.
Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I wanted to write. It was only something that came to my mind before I come to what I started two days ago: making a Sourdough starter.</description></item><item><title>Day310</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/01/day310/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/01/day310/</guid><description>WFH Day 310 I&amp;rsquo;m currently in Germany visiting my family. The Lockdown is strict, and just the essential stores are open. The infections are still pretty high, and the government talks about more restrictions to bring down the numbers.

I go outside for a walk around the lake and get some groceries.</description></item><item><title>Advent Of Code 2020</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2020/advent-of-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/2020/advent-of-code/</guid><description>Ho Ho Ho Now that we approach the last month of this extraordinary year, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to some coding challenges to distract myself and learn something new.

my 3D Printer drives me crazy (filament clogged the extruder, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the Teflon tube I needed to replace) working on some authentication-related issues for the CSDK, and it moves slow and brought up some obstacles along the way that makes the implementation more expensive.</description></item><item><title>Day205</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day205/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day205/</guid><description>WFH Day 205 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on some very tricky programming issues at work.

We all love to write unit great tests for our code. More or less.

Writing unit tests for my code mostly follows this pattern
Write a test and make it fail (red) Write the function to fix the test (implement function) Start over with step 1 For one of my projects, I was using jest. It&amp;rsquo;s fast now, and it has several features that I highly value.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Wallpaper Week 09/2017</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-09/_index09/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-09/_index09/</guid><description>Wallpaper Week 09/2017 Howdy New York February 2005. I arrived in New York for a weekend stop over on the way to San Francisco. I wanted to visit the The Gates in Central Park.
I was hoping for some snow during the night and some sun for Saturday morning. I wanted to capture the glowing orange fabric surrounded by the bright white environment. When I woke up Saturday morning, I was surprised to see that both wishes had come true.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Wallpaper Week 08/2017</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-08/_index08/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-08/_index08/</guid><description>Wallpaper Week 08/2017 Howdy I spent last Weekend in Yosemite, CA. It was a birthday present that my wife gave me. No children, away from home and time to attend a photography class in Yosemite. The class was organized from the Ansel Adams Gallery.
The class was 4 hours long and I took a lot of shots during the class. It was a lot of experimentation with the camera. How to deal with over-exposure, composition, color, white balancing, experiments with aperture priority, etc.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Wallpaper Week 07/2017</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-07/_index07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-07/_index07/</guid><description>Wallpaper Week 07/2017 Howdy I spent last Tuesday in San Jose, CA at the bi-annual Adobe developer conference that took place in the San Jose Convention Center.

About the Image Last Sunday I was spending some time walking around the football field at our middle school. The weather wasn&amp;rsquo;t that great. Grey and cloudy skies and lots of gusty winds. Then my little daughter showed up with some daisies she has picked from the field. It looked so fragile, how she was holding the tiny flowers in her little hands. Squeezed between her little fingers.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Wallpaper Week 05/2017</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-05/_index05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-05/_index05/</guid><description>Happy Monday!
About the Image As you can see: I love Santa Cruz!. This photo was taken on 02/14/2016. I spent the long weekend with my family in Santa Cruz. We stayed close to that beautiful beach and spent the afternoon in the sun.
The image was taken with a Sony Alpha A7II and the 28-70 mm Lens (53mm, f/9, 1⁄250, ISO 100).
I used Lightroom to crop the image a little bit.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Wallpaper Week 04/2017</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-04/_index04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/wallpaper/2017/week-04/_index04/</guid><description>Wallpaper Week 04/2017 About the Image Happy Monday!

I used the Lightroom Blue Hi-Contrast Filter for B/W conversion.</description></item><item><title>My Wallpaper Photo of the Week</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 23:30:45 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/post/my-wallpaper-photo-of-the-week/</guid><description>My Wallpaper Photo of the Week Every Monday, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week.

If you use a Unix based operating system, then you will be able to send any process a signal. This might be either Ctrl+C or SIGINT to interrupt that process. Or you can send SIGINFO to report the progress of it’s operation. Why this is awesome? Did you ever copy a huge amount of data and cp didn’t tell you how much has data has been copied so far?</description></item><item><title>Don't say it.

Try smarter.

Move faster.

render() { const content = React.Children.count(this.props.children) &amp;gt; 0 ? this.props.children[0] : this.props.children[1]; return ( ${content} ); } Unfortunately, this didn’t work (index out of bounds), when I passed only one component instead of two.

Running the script led to a lot of warnings about a missing library. I asked the person, if there are any dependencies for ant-contrib. His response was &amp;#34;yes, you need to install ant-contrib&amp;#34;.
First of all, I didn’t have ant installed. But that was easy with
