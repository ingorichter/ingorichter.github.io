[{"title":"Adding a Colorful Border Around macOS App Windows","date":"","description":"I found this little tool that allows you to add a colorful border to macOS windows.","body":"TL;DR JankyBorders is a tool that allows you to add a colored border around macOS app windows. This is helpful, especially in dark mode, to better see the window border and identify which application window is in front and active.\nWith a simple configuration file, it’s possible to specify the colors for the active and inactive windows. The program has more customizable options than I will discuss here. I focus on defining the colors for the active window and the inactive windows. I will also show how to use gradients and glow for borders.\nInstallation The easist way is to use homebrew. The instructions are available from JankyBorders. I mention the steps here to save you from opening another website. Open a new terminal window of your choice and type the following\nbrew tap FelixKratz/formulae brew install borders After installation, type borders \u0026amp; and after pressing enter, and a possible small delay, you will see a border around all the open application windows. You will see a white border around your terminal window.\nFinder Windows with White Border Finder Windows with White Border The border might not be easy to see in light mode. I switched to dark mode for demo purposes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to leave the borders program running. Therefore, I appended it with the \u0026amp; to ensure that the process is running in the background. To avoid having to launch borders everytime you restart your machine, you can create a LaunchAgent config and ensure that the program is launched automatically and runs in the background. If you installed borders with homebrew, you will automatically have a LaunchAgent config installed alongside the program.\nYou can enable borders as LauchAgent by running the following command\nbrew services start borders You can disable it by running the following command\nbrew services stop borders Configuration After each change in the config file, you need to restart the borders program to apply the changes.\nColors for Active and Inactive Windows Although there is a way to provide the config on the command line whan launching borders, I recommend to create a config file in the $HOME/.config/borders directory. The config file should be named borderrc. Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s a shell script that will launch borders with the provided options.\nBy default, all the colors are solid. But we can change them to be gradients or glow. Very nice feature.\nColor values are defined in the form of 0xAARRGGBB.\nOption Description AA The Alpha value controls the opacity. 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque. RR The Red value GG The Green value BB The Blue value All values are in hex and range from 00 to FF. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if they are in lower or upper case.\nThe config file should look like this\nI have a Retina display on my macbook and use the hidpi option.\n#!/bin/bash options=( hidpi=on active_color=0xff0000FF ) borders \u0026#34;${options[@]}\u0026#34; I changed the active border color to blue (RGB 0000FF). Finder Windows with Blue Border Finder Windows with Blue Border Inactive windows can have a different border color assigned. Let\u0026rsquo;s change the default color for inactive windows to red (RGB FF0000).\n#!/bin/bash options=( hidpi=on active_color=0xff0000FF inactive_color=0xffFF0000 ) borders \u0026#34;${options[@]}\u0026#34; Finder Windows with active and inactive boder color Finder Windows with active and inactive boder color Gradients You can also use gradients to provide a color gradient for the border. The value for any color can be a gradient in the form of gradient(top_left=0xffFF0000,bottom_right=0xff00FF00) or gradient(top_right=0xffFF0000,bottom_left=0xff00FF00).\nIt’s important to have the exact format of the gradient definition; otherwise, the border will not be rendered. I’m using zsh and the gradient definition has to be quoted.\nThe config file should look like this. I increased the border width to 20 to better see the gradient:\n#!/bin/bash options=( hidpi=on width=20.0 active_color=\u0026#34;gradient(top_left=0xffFF0000,bottom_right=0xff00FF00)\u0026#34; ) borders \u0026#34;${options[@]}\u0026#34; Finder Window with gradient from red to green Finder Window with gradient from red to green Glow You can also use a glow effect for the border. Any color can be used to define a glow effect in the form of glow(0xffFF0000). This glow definition will provide a red glow effect to the border. It looks a bit like a neon light around the window.\nThe config file should look like this:\n#!/bin/bash options=( hidpi=on width=20.0 active_color=\u0026#34;glow(0xffFF0000)\u0026#34; ) borders \u0026#34;${options[@]}\u0026#34; Finder Window with glow effect Finder Window with glow effect Allow and Deny Borders for Specific Applications You can also allow and deny applications from having a border. Unfortunately, the naming of this feature is not well thought out, since it’s using the blacklist and whitelist notion that should be avoided in my opinion.\nSpecify the name(s) of the application in the blacklist, and the whitelist will only allow and deny the specifically mentioned applications. All other applications will or will not have a border.\nThe config file should look like this:\n#!/bin/bash options=( hidpi=on width=20.0 active_color=0xff0000FF blacklist=\u0026#34;Finder\u0026#34; whitelist=\u0026#34;Safari\u0026#34; ) borders \u0026#34;${options[@]}\u0026#34; Safari windows are not allowed to have a border, but the Finder window is Safari windows are not allowed to have a border, but the Finder window is Conclusion In my opinion, the best way to add a border around macOS app windows is to use the JankyBorders program. I hope you’ll find it useful too. There are more options than I mentioned here. You can read about them by running man borders in the terminal.\nIf you have any feedback, please let me know.\nThanks for reading!\n","ref":"/post/2024/adding-a-colorful-border-around-macos-windows/"},{"title":"How to Learn New Things","date":"","description":"","body":"How to Learn New Things The world is full of interesting things, such as art, architecture, technology, and science. My time is limited, and I have too many interests to be able to follow them all. Fortunately, my job gives me the opportunity to work with technology, and there is always something new out there that I want to try and see if it fits in the context of my work.\nHow does one effectively learn about so many new things? Is there a proven recipe for digesting large amounts of information and having it available when needed? How can I connect ideas when I find a relationship between topics?\nI have numerous org-mode files on my computer, which I use in conjunction with Emacs and the denote tool to manage. This setup allows me to create connections and links between files as needed. It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to bookmark and collect information about topics as I learn about them. Finding information in these files is easy.\nI also have a Remarkable tablet, which I use for taking handwritten notes. I use it for random thoughts, sketches, meeting notes, and general notes when working on projects. It\u0026rsquo;s a great paper replacement, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any knowledge tracking capabilities.\nThe biggest challenge I face is focusing on what I want and need to learn. Reducing distractions and diving deeper into a topic is still difficult for me. I often get sidetracked while researching and end up feeling lost at the end of the day, wondering how I spent my time and what I accomplished. Even if I did achieve more than I think, it can still feel like a waste of time without tangible results.\nTo overcome this challenge, I need to narrow my focus and reduce distractions in order to learn about a topic in depth. This includes not only reading about the topic, but also trying things out and experimenting. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to trying out a more focused approach tomorrow, with my phone in focus mode, music without lyrics, and a clear vision for the day\u0026rsquo;s goals.\n","ref":"/post/2024/how-to-learn-new-things/"},{"title":"Losing Weight and Improve My Health","date":"","description":"A journey to a healthier life","body":"TL;DR I had some health issues at the end of 2023 that negatively impacted my quality of life. I had numerous doctor visits, and after several tests, the issue was diagnosed, and I received treatment. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling much better now. One thing the doctor ordered me to do is to lose weight - a lot of weight (~70 lbs) - and it should happen quickly. Another motivation to lose weight is to look better in my son\u0026rsquo;s graduation pictures in May. When he graduated from high school five years ago, I was shocked looking at the pictures. I felt bad about my appearance, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have that feeling again.\nWhere to start? The doctors\u0026rsquo;s recommendation was essentially to stop eating and start the day hungry and go to bed hungry. In other words, stop eating and live with a massive caloric deficit to lose weight. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in starvation diets. Your body goes into defense mode and tries to protect as much of the available energy. It\u0026rsquo;s a silly and dangerous idea.\n3 week fasting A friend of my wife gave me a plan for a three-week fast. This involved cutting down caloric intake to a bare minimum. It was challenging in the first couple of days, but I have some intermittent fasting experience, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad.\nHow it worked out I started on 01/23/24 with roughly 278 lbs and finished on 2/12/24 with 259 lbs. I lost 19 lbs, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud of it. Most importantly, the amount of body fat was reduced by 6.1 lbs, and my muscle mass stayed the same. That is good. I was exercising every other day. Nothing crazy for now. Rowing machine for 10 mins, then kettlebell training for 15-20 mins. And I have a daily goal to walk 1.5 miles. And on most days, I was able to do it.\nSome days, I craved certain foods. Not candy or sweets. Veggie broth, yogurt, cottage cheese, tea, coffee, and a small allowed selection of fruit and veggies didn\u0026rsquo;t seem appealing to me on some days. Then I noticed an interesting pattern: feeling bored, desperate, procrastinating, etc. I would go into the kitchen to look for something that I could eat. The problem was that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungry. It was only a way to satisfy any of the feelings that crept up. It seemed to me that I was compensating for those feelings with food. It would usually provide comfort, but not during this 3-week fast. I am prone to fall back into this trap once the weeks are over. I guess that is some sort of human weakness that I have to accept or find a solution.\nAnd what is the plan moving forward Now, it\u0026rsquo;s about reducing my weight further. In small steps with better eating habits. That entails not eating too late in the evening. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use 7 pm as the cutoff time. My other change will be to exercise at least 4 times per week. This will combine strength training and endurance training.\nI signed up for the fun Bay to Breakers on May 19th, 2024. I have not attended this event since 2017. This will be fun and I have a plan to exclusively exercise for this event in the upcoming weeks. The good thing about having to exercise with a goal in mind is that it keeps me motivated.\nI\u0026rsquo;m motivated to stay active and to change my eating habits. In general, I\u0026rsquo;m eating less food than at the beginning of the year. That is great. I want to see faster results when it comes to weight loss, but I\u0026rsquo;m aware of the fact that the weight didn\u0026rsquo;t come overnight, and getting rid of it will take some time. So, small progress is progress too. I always have to remind myself about it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a journey, and I\u0026rsquo;ll go this way further. I can do it.\n","ref":"/post/2024/losing-weight-and-improve-my-health/"},{"title":"What Ingo is up to","date":"","description":"","body":"📖 What I\u0026rsquo;m reading The 12-week year - Brian Moran Das Haus an der Moschee - Kader Abdolah Built to Move - Juliet Starrett and Kelly Starrett Palo Alto - Malcom Harris 📺 What I\u0026rsquo;m watching Love \u0026amp; Anarchy Money Heist Curb Your Enthusiasm 🧰 What I\u0026rsquo;m making Started to create some generative Art with vsketch 🔬 What I\u0026rsquo;m learning Practicing Rust Programming How to build a theme for Hugo ","ref":"/now/now/"},{"title":"Us Citizenship","date":"","description":"","body":"I\u0026rsquo;m a US Citizen Now 🇩🇪 + 🇺🇸 TL;DR On July 31, 2023, I received my US Citizenship certificate during the Oath Ceremony at the USCIS Field Office in San Francisco.

I could have done it alone, but I wanted to ensure the wording was unambiguous to avoid delays due to missing or unclear parts in the application. It was an excellent investment to have a professional Lawyer write the application and ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.\nI was nervous about the interview. I might fail it because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember some of the crucial players who wrote the essential documents that led to the founding of the USA. I learned every day for a couple of weeks—spaced repetition to the rescue to spread out the intervals for learning the facts. Ultimately, I remembered everything, and the questioning stopped after six correct answers. The remaining time of the interview, I was only asked about details from my N400 application.\nThe ceremony was a great moment to receive the US citizenship certificate.

I have time to decide until 5/8/2023 if I want to order it. After waiting a long time, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s an appropriate car for me. I like the idea of having an electric truck. It seemed the best way to justify such a big, unreasonable car. Given the state of competition in the EV market space and the crazy price hike for the F-150 since its introduction, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I feel excited about buying this truck. And then, there are rumors about technical issues with the F-150 that would delay the delivery by several months. No, thank you. Anyway, it was an exciting idea and something that kept me dreaming I started to exercise daily. Mobility and strength exercises to prevent problems with my body. I had a back issue last summer that lasted nearly six months. They only went away after some severe mobility and stretching exercise. I got a copy of Built to Move. The book talks about the importance of keeping the body moving. That\u0026rsquo;s all for now. I hope the weather will improve in the coming weeks.

Run the existing unit tests between more considerable changes and ensure that it stays in the green.\nAnd then, I discovered a potential piece of new code that could be expressed in a more concise, clearer, and compact way by leveraging some framework class that should help avoid duplication—quickly refactoring and changing the new code.

That\u0026rsquo;s weird; why does my working branch trigger that strange error? I didn\u0026rsquo;t change anything between Friday and now\u0026hellip; Wait a minute. Let me look at my last commit from Friday night. Hm, nothing suspicious. That\u0026rsquo;s weird. What the hell is going on? I can make the request, and it comes back with an error? What did I change? Hmm, I used the framework class to make everything more concise, clearer, and compact. Right, I remember now. That great optimization late Friday night. That saved a couple of lines and seemed to have broken something, which should make everything better.\nWell, I have to admit that I missed that class and broke something that impacted the generated URL to call the endpoint. Something was missing in the generated URL that triggered that never before seen error. After reading the docs for that class, I could quickly fix that issue. But it took me nearly 45 minutes to make sense of the things I saw.\nLesson learned: Do not make simple-looking changes late Friday night! Especially when you don\u0026rsquo;t run or test the code after changing it. Leave those changes for Monday or the following day.

To take care of myself and spend time away from my Computer.\nI went out for a hike up Mission Peak in Fremont, California. I heard about it and wanted to do it for quite some time. It was a great adventure. It was challenging, and I was tired like hell afterward. I got a sunburn on my face. Not great.\nI was crawling up the hill, and it was a strong reminder for me to exercise more.\nIt was beautiful out there. The sunshine, the Hanglider, and the Paraglider flew over my head. Many people were walking up to the top of the mountain. Cows and gobbling Turkeys left and right on the pasture.\nHalfway up to the top, I was so tired that I was thinking about returning early. I sat on a bench and looked over the Bay Area. I was greeted by another struggling hiker crawling up the hill. He didn\u0026rsquo;t look happy at all. We started chatting and continued our ascend together.\nWe were slow, but we had somebody to talk to. We talked about many different things. We had a couple of stops along the way, but it was easier than doing it alone. He was carrying a 25-pound backpack with food, water, a tent, clothes, and other survival equipment. He told me about him volunteering for a Search and Rescue troop in the Central Valley. Kudos, my friend!

It started in my teen years working with HP Plotters in our university lab at the TUHH. I could not afford an HP Plotter back in the day, so that desire was never satisfied.\nJumping forward to today: I bought the AxiDraw Plotter in the Summer of 2021, and I ordered the Magnetic Easel. That was all a good decision. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun tool, and I enjoy working with it. There was only one shortcoming that didn\u0026rsquo;t make me happy: the Magnetic Easel is not attached to the Plotter.\nIf I wanted to print something in multiple passes with different colors, I had to ensure that nothing moved while changing the pen. Otherwise, there would be an annoying offset. Long story short: I needed something to keep the distance constant between the Easel and the Plotter.\nI could have used Legos, Wood, or some other material, but I thought it was an excellent exercise to create a piece that fits the whole setup much better and can be printed on my 3D Printer.\nDesign a Spacer I took some measurements of the Plotter and the Easel and created a simple sketch that I could use to create a proper model. I planned to design something that I could print with my 3D Printer.\nSpacer Sketch Spacer Sketch That was enough information to get started on the design. Since I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use CAD software correctly, but I know how to write code, I settled for OpenSCAD to create the model.\nProgramming OpenSCAD Creating a model in OpenSCAD is something anybody can learn. I like that you can parameterize your models and make adjustments in code. The code is under version control, and I have a good history of what I changed and why. I believe that there is excellent CAD software out in the world that might provide the same features without writing code to design a model.\nThe image below shows the program and the rendered model. There are some similarities between the initial sketch and the rendered model :-)\nOpenSCAD Screenshot with the program and the rendered model OpenSCAD Screenshot with the program and the rendered model I have to admit that the creation took more time than I anticipated. One reason is that I had to learn how to express certain parts of the design in code, e.g., the frontStopper module. How to combine the different geometric shapes and the boolean operations to achieve what I wanted. The other reason that it took longer was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t do my initial measurements precisely enough 🤦‍♂️\nI had to iterate on the design, as you can see in the screenshot below. That meant printing the model on the 3D Printer and seeing if it fits.\nDifferent designs I created. The initial one at the bottom and the final Spacer at the top Different designs I created. The initial one at the bottom and the final Spacer at the top You can see the different modifications I made along the way. Sometimes subtle, sometimes bolder.\nThe Final Spacer Design The image shows what the final Spacer looks like today.\nThe final Spacer Design is bigger than the initial Design. The final Spacer Design is bigger than the initial Design. I printed the latest Design version that I am currently using on the Plotter in Silky Blue PLA. 15% Infill and no supports or brim. It took 45 minutes to print one. But I needed three of them. So, I printed one to ensure that everything fits just fines on the Plotter. And afterward, I printed two more to complete the setup.\nThe complete setup with 3 Spacers The complete setup with 3 Spacers Close Up Spacer Shot Close Up Spacer Shot Download If you are interested in the source code of the design, the STL, or both, then head over to my github repo and download the files from there. You can print it for personal use. If you have suggestions to improve the design, feel free to create a PR, and I will happily review it.\nThe model is also available from Printables\nConclusion The design phase was longer than I anticipated. Lack of practice and several rounds of trial and error contributed to that delay. But I learned a couple of things that will hopefully make my next design easier to realize. I like that I have a result that makes me happy and gives me a sense of accomplishment.\nSomething that I can see and use every time I use the Plotter for other projects. And if there is anything I want to adjust, I have the freedom to make those changes.\nThanks for reading.

Any Property or method needs its own @objc annotation to be visible from Objective-C. Use the @objcMembers annotation to expose all properties and methods of the Swift class Reminder for myself I learned a couple of essential things about mixing Objective-C and Swift in one project. I was using Swift for unit tests already, and that worked fine. Now, I wanted to implement a new class in Swift. But I wanted to use that class in an existing Objective-C class.\nSo far, so good. There is a lot of information on the internet about transitioning your Objective-C codebase to Swift. Everything I found looked pretty straightforward, and I wasn’t expecting a time sink by adding a simple Swift class to the project. But here we go… I created the new Swift class WithLoveFromSwift with one method, saySomethingNice. Pretty simple as a starting point.\nclass WithLoveFromSwift { func saySomethingNice() { return \u0026#34;Hello from Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } } I wanted to add that Swift class to the existing Objective-C implementation in the next step. And that’s where the problems started. I read that I have to add #import FancyGreeterApp-Swift.h in my Objective-C file to use the new Swift class. And that file is not created by XCode so that you can easily find it. But it will be there once you start compiling. They said. But it didn’t work. The import was causing an error, and the shiny new class didn’t appear in the code completion proposals.\nI spent a reasonable amount of time checking my project settings and other things I might have missed. It seemed that others had this problem too, and I wasn’t alone. But this didn’t help me resolve the issue.\nAfter more reading and confusion, I finally saw some slightly different code that deviated from mine. Their Swift class was public! Guess what? After adding public to my Swift class and compiling, the error regarding the import statement went away. Really? Public? That’s all that was missing?\n@objc public class WithLoveFromSwift { func saySomethingNice() { return \u0026#34;Hello from Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } } Anyway, it was compiling, and that was the most important thing.\nNow on to the next issue: my shiny class has a property greetingLanguage. This property should be accessible from Objective-C to set the language before creating a greeting. But the compiler once again was complaining that this property didn’t exist. Okay, I’m confused again. The property was public, in a public class. What else is needed?\n@objc public class WithLoveFromSwift { public var greetingLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; func saySomethingNice() { if greetingLanguage == \u0026#34;de\u0026#34; { return \u0026#34;Hallo Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } else { return \u0026#34;Hello Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } } } It turns out the @objc annotation at the class level exposed just the Swift class. If you want to expose the properties too, or some other methods, then you either have to prefix every property with @objc or you can use the @objcMembers annotation to enable access to all properties and methods of the Swift class.\nOkay, now I got it 👍🏼\n@objcMembers public class WithLoveFromSwift { public var greetingLanguage = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; func saySomethingNice() { if greetingLanguage == \u0026#34;de\u0026#34; { return \u0026#34;Hallo Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } else { return \u0026#34;Hello Swift ❤️\u0026#34; } } } Thanks for reading\n","ref":"/post/2022/til-adding-swift-code-to-objective-c-project/"},{"title":"WFH Day 702","date":"","description":"","body":"WFH Day 702 Well, well, well, I surpassed the 700 days since I started counting the WFH days in March 2020. That\u0026rsquo;s a long time ago, and a lot has changed in the meantime. Quality of life is better than before. No 3-hour daily commute in sticky and filthy trains, no more coffee shop visits after work, more time for reading, better-equipped work environment, not meeting some of my dearest co-workers in person anymore, taking lunch break walks, taking a nap if I don\u0026rsquo;t feel well, not seeing the dirty City anymore and feeling more productive in general.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t look forward to going back to the Office. My job and my position don\u0026rsquo;t require me to be there in person to do my job effectively. I understand that certain people will benefit from being surrounded by their peers and feel more productive being in the Office. I can have a quick in-person chat with random people on the same floor or in the cafeteria. These random encounters are valuable, but I also believe it\u0026rsquo;s overrated. Especially after the past years in this social experiment and demonstrating that we can work fully remote and deliver what we were asked. Sometimes even more.\nI understand that everybody had a different experience. Parents who had to take care of their children were hit hardest by the pandemic. The social contract doesn\u0026rsquo;t say anything about taking care of your children all day long. That\u0026rsquo;s what the school is for and childcare. Not every parent wanted to be a teacher during the daytime and a full-time worker between all job duties, sometimes late into the night. That workload is not what parents signed up for when they started their full-time jobs. I assume that most parents are happy to leave the house and go to the Office. Even if this means being jammed in traffic on the way to work and back. It\u0026rsquo;s sometimes hard to be around the same people for weeks or months. Even if they are you loved ones/family. So, the Office is a way to escape the singularity of being stuck at home. A much-needed distraction and place to get work done.\nAnyway, going back to the Office seems like a waste of energy and a lifetime that I can spend in more meaningful ways. Alone the commute time is making me anxious. I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy driving to the Office, nor do I need the clear separation between home and Office. There is hardly any reasonable explanation why the Office is the \u0026ldquo;only place where real work can happen\u0026rdquo;. This is a lame excuse, and I suspect that the underlying reason is mistrust in the workforce. Some people need and want constant visibility. This Ego boosting is necessary to have a prosperous career. That\u0026rsquo;s what they told me. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t see any difference in my career before and after the pandemic. So, I assume that I\u0026rsquo;m lacking some other ingredient for having a prosperous and happy career after all. No matter how productive, visible and outspoken I am. Let\u0026rsquo;s see when the call for RTO (return to Office) gets louder, and the herd of valuable employees has to reappear back in the sacred halls of their employers.\nTo be clear: I\u0026rsquo;m speaking for myself and the people who had the opportunity to stay at home and work in their safe environment during the pandemic. The situation for many people looked much different, and many of them had to risk their lives daily to fulfill the essential work that we all relied on: Doctors and Nurses, grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, sanitation workers, and train operators. Just to name a few. They were not as lucky as many of the other forced stay-at-home people. Those people had the right to complain about the inequality and how easy it was for us to take them for granted to keep the rest of our remaining lives as afloat and normal as possible.\nBut for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait and enjoy every day that I can work from the comfort of my home and enjoy the video chats with my co-workers. There will be a time when we meet again. Not daily, but the accessional and well-coordinated coffee break in the workplace.

But if you want to execute an open-source tool installed by brew or some other way on your machine, you will usually see something like this confirmation dialog. In this case, for an app FSNotes installed with brew.\nmacOS Gatekeeper Confirmation Dialog macOS Gatekeeper Confirmation Dialog It\u0026rsquo;s required to confirm this dialog before the app is launched. Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s fine so far.\nAdding more executable files at once to the system policy rule database Having one executable to confirm might be fine and not a big deal. In my case, I was using a tool OCLint that uses rules to lint Objective-C code. Those rules come in the form of dylibs. The current OCLint version installed on my machine has 76! separate dylibs loaded dynamically when OCLint needs the specific rule to lint the source code.\nUsing OCLint for the first will ask you to load one of the rule dylibs. Accept and try again. Now the next dylibs need your confirmation, and so on. That is tedious to add all required dylibs manually. There must be a better way to solve this problem.\nThe Command-Line to the Rescue After some searching, I found out that spctl (System Policy Control) is the tool to modify Gatekeeper (the end-user friendly name) and manipulate the policy system rule database that decides which code is allowed to be executed and which code is not.\nTo find out more about spctl run man spctl in a terminal app of your choice.\nOnly a small subset of spclt options are required to solve my problem. One thing that comes in handy is that you can create a label to add rules to this label and to enable/disable all rules that have this label.\nIn the end, I needed two things\nI added every OCLint rule dylib to the label OCLint find /usr/local/Caskroom/oclint/21.10/oclint-21.10/lib/oclint -name \u0026#34;*.dylib\u0026#34; -print0 | xargs -0 sudo spctl --add --label \u0026#34;OCLint\u0026#34; I enabled all rules in the OCLint label sudo spctl --enable --label \u0026#34;OCLint\u0026#34; Done! Now OCLint could work without asking for confirmation for every single dylib.\nResources The Post helped me to learn about spctl.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using the term rule here for two different systems. It might be confusing at times, but spctl uses the term Rule for every executable in the database. OCLint consists of linting rules for Objective-C source code.\nThanks for reading\n","ref":"/post/2022/adding-multiple-files-to-macos-gatekeeper/"},{"title":"WFH Day 693","date":"","description":"","body":"WFH Day 693 I\u0026rsquo;m back in California for a week now, and my Jetlag is finally gone.

I added baguetteBox.js for better image galleries and lazySizes to better support different image sizes in the gallery. I bundled the files and minified them in a single javascript file to reduce the number of requests to the server.\nI combined the mentioned JavaScript files into one file by having a customized version of scripts.html file that I copied from the original template source into the layouts/partials directory. The following lines show the steps to combine the js files into js/scripts.js.\n{{ $baguetteBox := resources.Get \u0026#34;js/external/baguetteBox.js\u0026#34; }} {{ $lazysizes := resources.Get \u0026#34;js/external/lazysizes.js\u0026#34; }} {{ $main := resources.Get \u0026#34;js/main.js\u0026#34; }} {{ $scripts := slice $baguetteBox $lazysizes $main | resources.Concat \u0026#34;js/scripts.js\u0026#34; | resources.Minify }} \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ $scripts.RelPermalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The problematic file in this process is js/main.js. The theme uses a file with this name as a template to generate other files during the blog creation. The template mechanism was using my version of the file, and the template mechanism failed, and then some essential files from the theme were missing. Those missing generated files led my blog to misbehave in some areas where the JavaScript files were required (search, language selection, sharing).\nThe Lookup Order describes how the lookup works to create the final layout for a section. What they don\u0026rsquo;t mention at all is the fact that the lookup logic is not only applied to layout files but also JavaScript files. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this holds for other file types.\nAfter some frustrating hours of debugging and examining my blog configuration, and inspecting the theme directory structure, I finally resolved this issue. I renamed my file from main.js to externMain.js. Any name would be better than main.js.\nSo, if you are encountering broken functionality or missing files after tinkering with a Hugo theme, I recommend inspecting your modified and added files.

I recently discovered that you could upload pictures from your phone into subfolders in the YEAR/MONTH/DAY/picturefile format.\nAfter switching this feature on, I realized that all my previously uploaded 3000+ images and short videos lie flat in the Pictures folder. I needed a solution to organize all existing photos into the same subfolder structure.\nI was thinking about writing a shell script and using ExifTool to read the EXIF metadata and move the pictures into their respective folder location based on their creation date. After checking the ExifTool documentation, I found out that ExifTool itself can help with this task.

Time flies like crazy, and we are in month 15 of the pandemic. It looks like the US is speeding up things a lot, and people get vaccinated in large quantities. I got my vaccine three weeks ago. This upcoming Thursday, I\u0026rsquo;ll receive my 2nd shot, and then I should be fully vaccinated two weeks later. The situation is not so great in Germany. Everything goes so slowly, and they are technically still in lockdown. This lockdown started beginning of November 2020. I was there to visit my family. There were short interruptions of the lockdown for Christmas (what a stupid idea) and again for Easter (why?!?). Germany has this Jojo effect that they wanted to avoid at any cost, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree on a stricter lockdown. And then they didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough vaccines to vaccinate the people on the top of the priority list. Everything moves so fu\u0026hellip;ing slowly there. And now they are facing another crisis: should people who are fully vaccinated get back some or all of their rights? This discussion is so tiring, and it will only drag everything on for longer than necessary, IMHO. I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard anybody here in the US talk discuss this issue. Out of respect for people who couldn\u0026rsquo;t be vaccinated yet, because they are not eligible yet or because they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough vaccine, all other people that are fully vaccinated or tested negative should not go along with their life? This is the problem of keeping everything restricted and unpleasant until the critical mass has been vaccinated or would be able to get the vaccine. How long will this go on? Throughout the summer? Fall? What\u0026rsquo;s the perspective? What\u0026rsquo;s the reasoning behind delaying it further and further? Is it only about fairness in society? Agree on the lowest common denominator for what is allowed for the whole population? Is this the solution and perspective that everybody in Germany needs right now? I can\u0026rsquo;t disagree more. Anyway, I already said way too much about this ongoing issue. But I\u0026rsquo;ll travel to Germany beginning of June, and I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that there won\u0026rsquo;t be many things possible for my family and me. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.

Things are moving slowly, and there are times when I think what the hell am I doing here. Luckily, this is a temporary state and will only get worse by working on something entirely different. Right, working on the leetcode October challenge can show me that things can get worse. Last night I spent 3 hours! On a simple (in retrospect, it was a straightforward) problem. Inserting something into a BST and return the resulting BST. Perhaps it was too late, I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay enough attention to the little details along the way, but I got something working on my machine, and when I pasted it into the leetcode editor, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working anymore. Great! WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING?! I got it working locally, and now this. Sigh. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the points for that day, and I went to bed slightly frustrated about the outcome. Anyway, it should be fun and entertaining, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nEarly this morning, I looked at the problem again and tried several things to debug the issue to make it work in leetcode. And then I finally found the stupid mistake I made. So, I could fix it and throw away 60% of my solution, since the code I wrote to turn an array with numbers into a BST was unnecessary at all. Since the input from the test case looked like an array, I built some function to create a BST from that serialized BST and then insert the new number into the BST. But the test case input was already an instance of the BST, and I just needed to binary search that tree and insert the value at the correct spot.\nLesson learned:\nread the instructions carefully inspect the input data from the test cases don\u0026rsquo;t do it late at night And perhaps use a different language with a better type system (I was initially using javascript). Looking at the TypeScript scaffold for the solution made it clear to me that the input to the function is an instance of the class defined in the comment. The function parameter didn\u0026rsquo;t show the type in the javascript version, and I skipped the function comment. So, an obvious User error.\nAnyway, I solved the problem today much more comfortable by being more careful.

He wanted to have something to place his new (and expensive) tamper for ground coffee. I always wanted to design and print something useful on my 3D Printer. And I wanted to learn and use OpenSCAD for a long time. Now I had an excellent reason to learn it.\nCreate the Design I had no experience with OpenSCAD at all when I started this little project. OpenSCAD comes with a lot of examples and a short Cheat Sheet that is extremely helpful in learning OpenSCAD.\nOpenSCAD uses a simple programming language to describe geometric shapes. These shapes can be modified by having functions to create them with variable parameters. That makes it easy to modify a design by changing a parameter, and everything that depends on that parameter will adjust accordingly. This parametric design principle is partly used by some professional-grade CAD programs (Fusion360, AutoCAD). It\u0026rsquo;s not a new thing. OpenSCAD has a much lower bar, IMHO, to create a parametric design.\nDesign Considerations I wanted to keep it simple for the first project. I envisioned a square that is big enough to hold the tool, a circle/cylinder on top of that square, to fit around the circular metal base of the tool tightly. The bottom should not be too big since it will be used in an environment with limited surface space. But it should not be too small to avoid falling over. So far, this sounds doable.\nThe challenges I encountered along the way\nHow do I create a hollow cylinder with a specific wall width? How can I create rounded corners for the square base? How can I add some text on top of the base (give it a personal note)? How can I add some text embossed on the side of the Base (copyright text)? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the implementation.\nCreating the Square Base module RoundedCornerSquareBase() { minkowski() { // the square base translate([0, 0, baseHeight / 2]) { color(\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;) cube([baseWidth, baseLength, baseHeight], center=true); } // create rounded corners cylinder(r=5, h=1); } } Create a module (like a function) and create the base square with cube and center it around all the axes. Use translate to move the square up the z-axis, so that the bottom of the square is not in the negative x and y coordinate space.\nThe tricky part for me was to figure out how to have rounded corners for the square. OpenSCAD provides the transformation function minkowski that will sum up multiple shapes into one shape. More details are available here. minkowski takes the cube and the cylinder from the code above and sums them up into a square with rounded corners. This sum increases the width and height of the square by the radius of the cylinder.\nSquare Base rendered in OpenSCAD Add the Hollow Cylinder module HollowCylinder() { translate([0, 0, baseHeight]) { difference() { cylinder(h=maxHeight, d=diameter + wallThickness); cylinder(h=maxHeight, d=diameter); } }; } The solution was not too difficult after I found the difference function. Take two cylinders with different diameters and place them in the same position and let the difference function figure it out.\nHollow Cylinder rendered in OpenSCAD Add the Text on top of the Base module CoffeeShopName() { // place coffee shop name on top of base translate([0, -39, baseHeight + 1]) { linear_extrude(0.5) { text(coffeeShopName, font=\u0026#34;Gill Sans:style=Bold\u0026#34;, size=9, halign=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34;); } } } Placing the text was a bit of trial and error to find the correct position on top of the base square. Then I encountered the issue that the text height wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to stick out a bit from the surface. After inspecting examples and searching the internet, I found that linear_extrude function that can be used to make something flat grow in height.\nTop Text rendered in OpenSCAD Add the debossed Text on the side of the Base module RoundedCornerSquareBase() { minkowski() { // the square base translate([0, 0, baseHeight / 2]) { color(\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;) cube([baseWidth, baseLength, baseHeight], center=true); } // create rounded corners cylinder(r=5, h=1); } } module CopyrightNotice() { mirror([0, 180, 0]) { rotate([90, 0, 180]) { translate([0, 3, -44]) { linear_extrude(2) { text(copyrightName, size=6, halign=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34;); } } } } } difference() { RoundedCornerSquareBase(); CopyrightNotice(); } This text placed on the side of the square base took the most time for me to implement. I had come up with this solution that combines mirror, rotate, translate, and linear_extrude to create a simple text on the side of the base. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want this text to sit on top of the surface. So, I had to trial and error my way to find the correct placement. Once I had the correct position, I used the difference function to get the text debossed into the square base. It was worth it in the end, and I was happy with the result.\nDebossed Text rendered in OpenSCAD The Result The combination of all the code snippets looks like this.\nCoffee Distribution Tool Base rendering in OpenSCAD OpenSCAD Project Files The project Files are located in my github repository\nPrint Settings I printed the base on my Prusa i3 MKS2 with MMU2 with PETG Filament from Atomic Filament. I used PrusaSlicer 2.2.1 to slice the model with 20% Infill and no support on the smooth metal sheet.\nSummary It was fun to learn a different way to create 3D models. It takes some time to do certain things, like the copyright text. OpenSCAD is a powerful tool to program your 3D models. There are a lot of great examples that come with OpenSCAD, and I recommend inspecting them to learn how to realize specific effects. Since you have a programming language with control structures, loops, and functions, there are endless possibilities to create compelling models that would be otherwise difficult to realize (look at module_recursion.scad).\nIf you find it useful or if you have questions, leave a comment and share this post.

And to anybody who needs a creative solution to test an event handler directly attached to a DOM node of a react component.\nLast Friday I ran into the situation to test my react component to ensure that the state updates correctly when the pointerenter and pointerleave event fires. Testing for these events is usually no big deal when you use reactjs in one way or the other (either web or native). At work we use an internal framework that is react API compatible and implements most of the features of react. Most of them, but not all.\nI ran into the situation where I have the pointerenter event handler defined, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t fire. The team recommended to replace it with an event handler directly attached to the DOM node by\nassign a ref to the component attach the event handler to the ref This is how it looked like class ImageHover extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this._hoverBoxRef = React.CreateRef(); } function _toggleHoverState = (state) =\u0026gt; { this.setState({ isNormal: state }); function componentDidMount() { this._hoverBoxRef.current.addEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerenter\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(false)); this._hoverBoxRef.current.addEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerleave\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(true)); } function componentWillUnmount() { this._hoverBoxRef.current.removeEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerenter\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(false)); this._hoverBoxRef.current.removeEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerleave\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(true)); } render () { style = this.state.isNormal ? \u0026#34;normal\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;hover\u0026#34;; return ( \u0026lt;div className={ style } onClick={this.props.onClick} ref={this._hoverBoxRef} /\u0026gt; ); }\nTo ensure that the component changes the style to hover when the pointerenter event fires and back to normal when pointerleave is fired can usually achieved by using the rendered component and call .simulate(\u0026quot;pointerEnter\u0026quot;) when using jest and enzyme.\nNormal test\ncb = jest.fn(); imageHover = mount(\u0026lt;ImageHover imageName={\u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;} onClick={cb} /\u0026gt;); it(\u0026#34;should change state on pointerEnter\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { imageHover.simulate(\u0026#34;pointerEnter\u0026#34;); expect(imageHover.state().isNormal).toEqual(false); }); Since the pointerEnter event didn\u0026rsquo;t fire in my situation, I had to find another way to trigger that event. Here is the modified test\ncb = jest.fn(); imageHover = mount(\u0026lt;ImageHover imageName={\u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;} onClick={cb} /\u0026gt;); it(\u0026#34;should change state on pointerEnter\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { const domNode = imageHover.getDOMNode(); const event = new Event(\u0026#34;pointerenter\u0026#34;); domNode.dispatchEvent(event); expect(imageHover.state().isNormal).toEqual(false); }); The tiny difference is getting access to the underlying DOM element during the test execution and dispatch the pointerenter event on that DOM node. I\u0026rsquo;ve omitted the event details in this example since they aren\u0026rsquo;t relevant for the demo purpose. Perhaps there is an alternative solution to achieve the same result without the direct DOM access. Let me know, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to update my test code.\nThank you very much for reading!\n","ref":"/post/testing-dom-event-handler-in-reactjs/"},{"title":"ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk","date":"","description":"Some notes from the recent SF ReactJS Meetup","body":"ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk Thursday night I attended the SF ReactJS Meetup at Zendesk.\nFirst of all, there were some noticeable difference to some other meetups I went to in the past,\nNo need to sign No need to sign an NDA before entering the premise No Pizza!

Let’s see, how Snapshot testing will help solve this task.\n1Verify that new todo item has all required fields 2 3 expect(received).toEqual(expected) 4 5 Expected value to equal: 6 {} 7 Received: 8 {\u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;isPriority\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New Task\u0026#34;} 9 10 Difference: 11 12 - Expected 13 + Received 14 15 -Object {} 16 +Object { 17 + \u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, 18 + \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, 19 + \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: Array [ 20 + \u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, 21 + \u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;, 22 + ], 23 + \u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, 24 + \u0026#34;isPriority\u0026#34;: false, 25 + \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;: Array [ 26 + \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;, 27 + ], 28 + \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New Task\u0026#34;, 29 +} 30 31 at Object.\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;.test (__tests__/newTask-test.js:7:25) 32 at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7) 33 34 PASS __tests__/add-test.js 35 36Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total 37Tests: 1 failed, 1 passed, 2 total 38Snapshots: 0 total 39Time: 1.042s 40Ran all test suites.

Three notable things I still didn’t provide a full-fledged object that matches my expectation toMatchSnapshot() was the only code change in the test The number of Snapshots in the status output of Jest is now 1! What happened? Jest was taking a Snapshot for that test and was happy with the result. Under the hood, Jest created a __snapshots__ directory in my __tests__ directory and saved the output of the test result. The file is named after the file containing the test. In this case, it’s newTask-test.js.snap. Here are the contents of that Snapshot file.\n1// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP 2 3exports[`Verify that new todo item has all required fields 1`] = ` 4Object { 5 \u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, 6 \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, 7 \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: Array [ 8 \u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;, 10 ], 11 \u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, 12 \u0026#34;isPriority\u0026#34;: false, 13 \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;: Array [ 14 \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;, 15 ], 16 \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New Task\u0026#34;, 17} 18`; The key of the exports object is the name of the test itself. The value of it is the result from createTodoItem(\u0026quot;New Task\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;blog\u0026quot;], [\u0026quot;learn\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;programming\u0026quot;], \u0026quot;2017-04-17\u0026quot;). That is great. I didn’t have to type a line of code for the expected result of this function. By doing a quick visual inspection of the output, I can confirm that this is the expected output.\nNow it gets interesting. I’m going to change the return object of the function. The result object will have a new key completedDate and the completed flag will be removed. Let’s see how Jest handles the situation without making any change to the existing, and currently passing, test.\n1 FAIL __tests__/newTask-test.js 2 ● Verify that new todo item has all required fields 3 4 expect(value).toMatchSnapshot() 5 6 Received value does not match stored snapshot 1. 7 8 - Snapshot 9 + Received 10 11 @@ -1,8 +1,8 @@ 12 Object { 13 \u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, 14 - \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, 15 + \u0026#34;completedDate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 16 \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: Array [ 17 \u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, 18 \u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;, 19 ], 20 \u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, 21 22 at Object.\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;.test (__tests__/newTask-test.js:8:25) 23 at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7) 24 25 PASS __tests__/add-test.js 26 27Snapshot Summary 28 › 1 snapshot test failed in 1 test suite.

The output of the test run informs me that the Received value does not match stored snapshot 1. That is correct, and it was expected. But more importantly, Jest tells me to inspect my code changes or run the tests again with a specific flag to update the snapshot. Since it was an intentional change, I’m going to run the test again with npm test -- -u to update the Snapshot.\n1\u0026gt; jest \u0026#34;-u\u0026#34; 2 3 PASS __tests__/newTask-test.js 4 PASS __tests__/add-test.js 5 6Snapshot Summary 7 › 1 snapshot updated in 1 test suite. 8 9Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total 10Tests: 2 passed, 2 total 11Snapshots: 1 updated, 1 total 12Time: 1.115s 13Ran all test suites. The Snapshot got updated and reflects the current implementation of my function. Well done! No code is written to create the expected result object. This is where Snapshot testing is awesome.\nSummary I hope that this example helped to understand the Snapshot testing capability of Jest. IMHO, this approach is excellent for two reasons:\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have to write code to compare complex result objects Less test code to write, easier to read, more time to work on features Snapshot testing might not be necessary/wanted for all kind of tests. You might choose the traditional way for simpler functions. To verify complex result objects, this is an efficient way for testing. Having to write less code is always a great way to improve efficiency.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact me, if you have questions or suggestions.
