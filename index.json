Things are moving slowly, and there are times when I think what the hell am I doing here. Luckily, this is a temporary state and will only get worse by working on something entirely different. Right, working on the leetcode October challenge can show me that things can get worse. Last night I spent 3 hours! On a simple (in retrospect, it was a straightforward) problem. Inserting something into a BST and return the resulting BST. Perhaps it was too late, I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay enough attention to the little details along the way, but I got something working on my machine, and when I pasted it into the leetcode editor, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working anymore. Great! WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING?! I got it working locally, and now this. Sigh. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the points for that day, and I went to bed slightly frustrated about the outcome. Anyway, it should be fun and entertaining, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nEarly this morning, I looked at the problem again and tried several things to debug the issue to make it work in leetcode. And then I finally found the stupid mistake I made. So, I could fix it and throw away 60% of my solution, since the code I wrote to turn an array with numbers into a BST was unnecessary at all. Since the input from the test case looked like an array, I built some function to create a BST from that serialized BST and then insert the new number into the BST. But the test case input was already an instance of the BST, and I just needed to binary search that tree and insert the value at the correct spot.\nLesson learned:\n read the instructions carefully inspect the input data from the test cases don\u0026rsquo;t do it late at night  And perhaps use a different language with a better type system (I was initially using javascript). Looking at the TypeScript scaffold for the solution made it clear to me that the input to the function is an instance of the class defined in the comment. The function parameter didn\u0026rsquo;t show the type in the javascript version, and I skipped the function comment. So, an obvious User error.\nAnyway, I solved the problem today much more comfortable by being more careful. And the Oakland Athletics won the 3rd game of the postseason beating the sh** out of the Astros.

He wanted to have something to place his new (and expensive) tamper for ground coffee. I always wanted to design and print something useful on my 3D Printer. And I wanted to learn and use OpenSCAD for a long time. Now I had an excellent reason to learn it.\nCreate the Design  I had no experience with OpenSCAD at all when I started this little project. OpenSCAD comes with a lot of examples and a short Cheat Sheet that is extremely helpful in learning OpenSCAD.\n OpenSCAD uses a simple programming language to describe geometric shapes. These shapes can be modified by having functions to create them with variable parameters. That makes it easy to modify a design by changing a parameter, and everything that depends on that parameter will adjust accordingly. This parametric design principle is partly used by some professional-grade CAD programs (Fusion360, AutoCAD). It\u0026rsquo;s not a new thing. OpenSCAD has a much lower bar, IMHO, to create a parametric design.\nDesign Considerations I wanted to keep it simple for the first project. I envisioned a square that is big enough to hold the tool, a circle/cylinder on top of that square, to fit around the circular metal base of the tool tightly. The bottom should not be too big since it will be used in an environment with limited surface space. But it should not be too small to avoid falling over. So far, this sounds doable.\nThe challenges I encountered along the way\n How do I create a hollow cylinder with a specific wall width? How can I create rounded corners for the square base? How can I add some text on top of the base (give it a personal note)? How can I add some text embossed on the side of the Base (copyright text)?  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the implementation.\nCreating the Square Base module RoundedCornerSquareBase() { minkowski() { // the square base  translate([0, 0, baseHeight / 2]) { color(\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;) cube([baseWidth, baseLength, baseHeight], center=true); } // create rounded corners  cylinder(r=5, h=1); } } Create a module (like a function) and create the base square with cube and center it around all the axes. Use translate to move the square up the z-axis, so that the bottom of the square is not in the negative x and y coordinate space.\nThe tricky part for me was to figure out how to have rounded corners for the square. OpenSCAD provides the transformation function minkowski that will sum up multiple shapes into one shape. More details are available here. minkowski takes the cube and the cylinder from the code above and sums them up into a square with rounded corners. This sum increases the width and height of the square by the radius of the cylinder.\n  Square Base rendered in OpenSCAD   Add the Hollow Cylinder module HollowCylinder() { translate([0, 0, baseHeight]) { difference() { cylinder(h=maxHeight, d=diameter + wallThickness); cylinder(h=maxHeight, d=diameter); } }; } The solution was not too difficult after I found the difference function. Take two cylinders with different diameters and place them in the same position and let the difference function figure it out.\n  Hollow Cylinder rendered in OpenSCAD   Add the Text on top of the Base module CoffeeShopName() { // place coffee shop name on top of base  translate([0, -39, baseHeight + 1]) { linear_extrude(0.5) { text(coffeeShopName, font=\u0026#34;Gill Sans:style=Bold\u0026#34;, size=9, halign=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34;); } } } Placing the text was a bit of trial and error to find the correct position on top of the base square. Then I encountered the issue that the text height wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to stick out a bit from the surface. After inspecting examples and searching the internet, I found that linear_extrude function that can be used to make something flat grow in height.\n  Top Text rendered in OpenSCAD   Add the debossed Text on the side of the Base module RoundedCornerSquareBase() { minkowski() { // the square base  translate([0, 0, baseHeight / 2]) { color(\u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;) cube([baseWidth, baseLength, baseHeight], center=true); } // create rounded corners  cylinder(r=5, h=1); } } module CopyrightNotice() { mirror([0, 180, 0]) { rotate([90, 0, 180]) { translate([0, 3, -44]) { linear_extrude(2) { text(copyrightName, size=6, halign=\u0026#34;center\u0026#34;); } } } } } difference() { RoundedCornerSquareBase(); CopyrightNotice(); } This text placed on the side of the square base took the most time for me to implement. I had come up with this solution that combines mirror, rotate, translate, and linear_extrude to create a simple text on the side of the base. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want this text to sit on top of the surface. So, I had to trial and error my way to find the correct placement. Once I had the correct position, I used the difference function to get the text debossed into the square base. It was worth it in the end, and I was happy with the result.\n  Debossed Text rendered in OpenSCAD   The Result The combination of all the code snippets looks like this.\n  Coffee Distribution Tool Base rendering in OpenSCAD   OpenSCAD Project Files The project Files are located in my github repository\nPrint Settings I printed the base on my Prusa i3 MKS2 with MMU2 with PETG Filament from Atomic Filament. I used PrusaSlicer 2.2.1 to slice the model with 20% Infill and no support on the smooth metal sheet.\nSummary It was fun to learn a different way to create 3D models. It takes some time to do certain things, like the copyright text. OpenSCAD is a powerful tool to program your 3D models. There are a lot of great examples that come with OpenSCAD, and I recommend inspecting them to learn how to realize specific effects. Since you have a programming language with control structures, loops, and functions, there are endless possibilities to create compelling models that would be otherwise difficult to realize (look at module_recursion.scad).\n If you find it useful or if you have questions, leave a comment and share this post.

And to anybody who needs a creative solution to test an event handler directly attached to a DOM node of a react component.\nLast Friday I ran into the situation to test my react component to ensure that the state updates correctly when the pointerenter and pointerleave event fires. Testing for these events is usually no big deal when you use reactjs in one way or the other (either web or native). At work we use an internal framework that is react API compatible and implements most of the features of react. Most of them, but not all.\nI ran into the situation where I have the pointerenter event handler defined, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t fire. The team recommended to replace it with an event handler directly attached to the DOM node by\n assign a ref to the component attach the event handler to the ref  This is how it looked like class ImageHover extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this._hoverBoxRef = React.CreateRef(); } function _toggleHoverState = (state) =\u0026gt; { this.setState({ isNormal: state }); function componentDidMount() { this._hoverBoxRef.current.addEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerenter\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(false)); this._hoverBoxRef.current.addEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerleave\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(true)); } function componentWillUnmount() { this._hoverBoxRef.current.removeEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerenter\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(false)); this._hoverBoxRef.current.removeEventListener(\u0026#39;pointerleave\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; this._toggleHoverState(true)); } render () { style = this.state.isNormal ? \u0026#34;normal\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;hover\u0026#34;; return ( \u0026lt;div className={ style } onClick={this.props.onClick} ref={this._hoverBoxRef} /\u0026gt; ); }\nTo ensure that the component changes the style to hover when the pointerenter event fires and back to normal when pointerleave is fired can usually achieved by using the rendered component and call .simulate(\u0026quot;pointerEnter\u0026quot;) when using jest and enzyme.\nNormal test\ncb = jest.fn(); imageHover = mount(\u0026lt;ImageHover imageName={\u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;} onClick={cb} /\u0026gt;); it(\u0026#34;should change state on pointerEnter\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { imageHover.simulate(\u0026#34;pointerEnter\u0026#34;); expect(imageHover.state().isNormal).toEqual(false); }); Since the pointerEnter event didn\u0026rsquo;t fire in my situation, I had to find another way to trigger that event. Here is the modified test\ncb = jest.fn(); imageHover = mount(\u0026lt;ImageHover imageName={\u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;} onClick={cb} /\u0026gt;); it(\u0026#34;should change state on pointerEnter\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { const domNode = imageHover.getDOMNode(); const event = new Event(\u0026#34;pointerenter\u0026#34;); domNode.dispatchEvent(event); expect(imageHover.state().isNormal).toEqual(false); }); The tiny difference is getting access to the underlying DOM element during the test execution and dispatch the pointerenter event on that DOM node. I\u0026rsquo;ve omitted the event details in this example since they aren\u0026rsquo;t relevant for the demo purpose. Perhaps there is an alternative solution to achieve the same result without the direct DOM access. Let me know, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to update my test code.\nThank you very much for reading!\n","ref":"/post/testing-dom-event-handler-in-reactjs/"},{"title":"ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk","date":"","description":"Some notes from the recent SF ReactJS Meetup","body":"ReactJS San Francisco Meetup at Zendesk Thursday night I attended the SF ReactJS Meetup at Zendesk.\nFirst of all, there were some noticeable difference to some other meetups I went to in the past,\n No need to sign No need to sign an NDA before entering the premise No Pizza!

A bunch of files has been changed, nothing has settled yet and lots of uncommitted changes. This is how work in progress looks like. Everything could be alright, but then you are asked to check out that high priority issue that a customer reported.\nWhat I did in this situation\n stash my changes with git stash save and provide a meaningful message for when I have to unstash- my changes changes branches and pull from master build the product repro the issue create a new branch for the fix implement the fix and push to the newly created branch let somebody else verify the fix go back to my previous branch git stash pop my work in progress continue working on the feature  Introducing Worktrees I was reading git release notes, and I stumbled upon something I haven’t heard before in the git context: worktree. It’s not a new feature. It was introduced back in 2015, but I discovered it a couple of weeks ago. It reminded me of the time when I used Perforce, and I had to create a Workspace for everything I was working on (okay, it wasn’t that bad).\nThe help for git help worktree gives you a very short summary of some operations available for worktrees.\nNAME git-worktree - Manage multiple working trees SYNOPSIS git worktree add [-f] [--detach] [--checkout] [--lock] [-b \u0026lt;new-branch\u0026gt;] \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;] git worktree list [--porcelain] git worktree lock [--reason \u0026lt;string\u0026gt;] \u0026lt;worktree\u0026gt; git worktree prune [-n] [-v] [--expire \u0026lt;expire\u0026gt;] git worktree unlock \u0026lt;worktree\u0026gt; Sounds interesting to me. Let’s check it out.\nIMHO worktrees have a couple of advantages over another git clone:\n less space wasted with another clone of the same repo easier to compare files between different worktrees work on multiple branches of the same repo without the hassle of messing everything up when switching branches (this happened a lot for me in the past)   BTW: the current project directory is a worktree too.\n There might be other good solutions to support that sort of workflows. Git is versatile and powerful. It has a lot to offer, and there are so many different ways to achieve the same result. Worktrees are a great addition, and they make good sense.

More or less.\n— Unknown Programmer\n Writing unit tests for my code mostly follows this pattern\n Write a test and make it fail (red) Write the function to fix the test (implement function) Start over with step 1  For one of my projects, I was using jest. It\u0026rsquo;s fast now, and it has several features that I highly value. Most of them integrated code coverage and Snapshot testing.\nSnapshot testing? What\u0026rsquo;s that? When I first saw the part about Snapshot testing, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested. Okay, it was more that I thought, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t see a big advantage here over the traditional approach of testing my code.

Yes, I didn’t write yet the expected object to compare the result with. I’m too lazy, and I always want to avoid writing it. What I’m doing instead, is to call the function, copy the result and create my expected result object with this data. But for now, I’m not going to do it.

Three notable things  I still didn’t provide a full-fledged object that matches my expectation toMatchSnapshot() was the only code change in the test The number of Snapshots in the status output of Jest is now 1!  What happened? Jest was taking a Snapshot for that test and was happy with the result. Under the hood, Jest created a __snapshots__ directory in my __tests__ directory and saved the output of the test result. The file is named after the file containing the test. In this case, it’s newTask-test.js.snap. Here are the contents of that Snapshot file.\n1// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP 2 3exports[`Verify that new todo item has all required fields 1`] = ` 4Object { 5\u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, 6\u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, 7\u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: Array [ 8\u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, 9\u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;, 10], 11\u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, 12\u0026#34;isPriority\u0026#34;: false, 13\u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;: Array [ 14\u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;, 15], 16\u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New Task\u0026#34;, 17} 18`;  The key of the exports object is the name of the test itself. The value of it is the result from createTodoItem(\u0026quot;New Task\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;blog\u0026quot;], [\u0026quot;learn\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;programming\u0026quot;], \u0026quot;2017-04-17\u0026quot;). That is great. I didn’t have to type a line of code for the expected result of this function. By doing a quick visual inspection of the output, I can confirm that this is the expected output.\nNow it gets interesting. I’m going to change the return object of the function. The result object will have a new key completedDate and the completed flag will be removed. Let’s see how Jest handles the situation without making any change to the existing, and currently passing, test.\n1 FAIL __tests__/newTask-test.js 2 ● Verify that new todo item has all required fields 3 4 expect(value).toMatchSnapshot() 5 6 Received value does not match stored snapshot 1. 7 8 - Snapshot 9 + Received 10 11 @@ -1,8 +1,8 @@ 12 Object { 13 \u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: false, 14 - \u0026#34;completed\u0026#34;: false, 15 + \u0026#34;completedDate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, 16 \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: Array [ 17 \u0026#34;learn\u0026#34;, 18 \u0026#34;programming\u0026#34;, 19 ], 20 \u0026#34;due\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2017-04-17\u0026#34;, 21 22 at Object.\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;.test (__tests__/newTask-test.js:8:25) 23 at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:109:7) 24 25 PASS __tests__/add-test.js 26 27Snapshot Summary 28 › 1 snapshot test failed in 1 test suite.

The output of the test run informs me that the Received value does not match stored snapshot 1. That is correct, and it was expected. But more importantly, Jest tells me to inspect my code changes or run the tests again with a specific flag to update the snapshot. Since it was an intentional change, I’m going to run the test again with npm test -- -u to update the Snapshot.\n1\u0026gt; jest \u0026#34;-u\u0026#34; 2 3 PASS __tests__/newTask-test.js 4 PASS __tests__/add-test.js 5 6Snapshot Summary 7 › 1 snapshot updated in 1 test suite. 8 9Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total 10Tests: 2 passed, 2 total 11Snapshots: 1 updated, 1 total 12Time: 1.115s 13Ran all test suites.  The Snapshot got updated and reflects the current implementation of my function. Well done! No code is written to create the expected result object. This is where Snapshot testing is awesome.\nSummary I hope that this example helped to understand the Snapshot testing capability of Jest. IMHO, this approach is excellent for two reasons:\n I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write code to compare complex result objects Less test code to write, easier to read, more time to work on features  Snapshot testing might not be necessary/wanted for all kind of tests. You might choose the traditional way for simpler functions. To verify complex result objects, this is an efficient way for testing. Having to write less code is always a great way to improve efficiency.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact me, if you have questions or suggestions.

In recent job interviews, I asked candidates if they tried tool/framework/language/skill that is useful for the job.\n In a lot of cases, I heard one of the following answers - nobody asked me to look at it - I was busy doing my day to day job - my Manager didn’t give me permission to do so\n I totally understand that we are all living busy lives. I have a demanding full time job, a family and some friends. All of them require time and time is a scarce resource. Once it’s gone, you won’t get it back. So act wisely!

This doesn’t make sense since the Toggle is supposed to toggle between two components. So, you could argue, that I broke the contract by not passing two child components to Toggle. That is all true.\n What I want to show instead, is the fact that if you pass only one child component, then this.props.children is not an array anymore. this.props.children is the one component. Which explains the index out of bounds error.\n Some information about dealing with this.props.children is available here.\n Thanks for reading!\n ","ref":"/post/reactjs-optimizations/"},{"title":"TIL - where to put ant-contrib","date":"","description":"","body":"I was testing an ant based build script change today. And I thought ant was already retired.\n Running the script led to a lot of warnings about a missing library. I asked the person, if there are any dependencies for ant-contrib. His response was \u0026#34;yes, you need to install ant-contrib\u0026#34;.\n First of all, I didn’t have ant installed. But that was easy with\n irichter@irichter-MacBookPro:~ brew install ant   Unfortunately, ant-contrib wasn’t available via homebrew, so I had to download it and place it…​ where? Ah, in the lib folder of your ant installation. Okay, that might one solution. I remembered, that years ago I was using it in a different way. There was another location where ant was looking for additional jars.\n This worked for me  create or locate the ~/.ant/lib directory\n  copy all additional jars in this directory\n   From now on, ant will be able to find ant-contrib and I don’t have to mess around with the ant installation directory. Clean, nice and simple solution.\n   Note  I don’t know, if this will work on Windows in the same way.
