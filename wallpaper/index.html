This photo was taken on 02/14/2016. I spent the long weekend with my family in Santa Cruz.

I made some adjustements on the white balance and bumped the sharpness slightly up.</p><figure><img class=lazyload data-src=/wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz.jpg data-srcset="/wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_53ee2013129d1e9a.jpg 20w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_ecb48ca15813b1c3.jpg 320w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_1505a609b1911f78.jpg 480w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_ce58c4ceba98e5ee.jpg 768w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_4451e9f4bc3c5355.jpg 1024w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_c54f3118c7d077bf.jpg 1280w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_b0edbde9b5d787c8.jpg 1600w, /wallpaper/2017/week-05/waves_hit_the_rocks_in_santa_cruz_hu_4c6f5557b7842986.jpg 1920w" alt="Waves hit the rock"><figcaption>Waves hit the rock and make a big splash</figcaption></figure><p>Santa Cruz Beach</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>Feel free to share, leave a comment or just enjoy looking at it.</p></ul><ul><li><a href=/wallpaper/2017/week-06/>Weekly Wallpaper Week 06/2017</a></li><h2 id=wallpaper-week-062017>Wallpaper Week 06/2017</h2><p><strong>Happy Monday!</strong></p><h3 id=about-the-image>About the Image</h3><p>Last Sunday I was spending some time walking around the football field at our middle school. The weather wasn&rsquo;t that great. Grey and cloudy skies and lots of gusty winds.
Then my little daughter showed up with some daisies she has picked from the field.
It looked so fragile, how she was holding the tiny flowers in her little hands. Squeezed between her little fingers.
Her purple jacket and the blue ball made were a great colorful subject that day.</p><p>The image was taken with a <a href=https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7m2-body-kit title="Sony Alpha A7II">Sony Alpha A7II</a> and the 28-70 mm Lens (44mm, f/4.5, 1‚ÅÑ160, ISO 125).</p><p>I used Lightroom 6.8 to crop the image.

The evening of the second day usually ends with the TechFair. Teams are showing off what they are working on. That&rsquo;s the most interesting part of the whole conference. You get some ideas about what is going on in the company and where we are heading.
The whole decoration for the venue was using glow sticks all over the place.

It was a birthday present that my wife gave me. No children, away from home and time to attend a photography class in Yosemite. The class was organized from the Ansel Adams Gallery.</p><p>The class was 4 hours long and I took a lot of shots during the class. It was a lot of experimentation with the camera. How to deal with over-exposure, composition, color, white balancing, experiments with aperture priority, etc.</p><p>The photo was taken outside the national park. On the way to Yosemite Valley, I stopped on this little bridge. I went down to the river and tried several things with the camera. I enjoyed the white noise of the rushing river. Then I discovered the stone pyramid that somebody left behind. I like those pyramids. They look fragile and solid at the same time. And it seems, that the recent storms didn&rsquo;t do any harm to it.</p><h3 id=about-the-image>About the Image</h3><p>The image was taken with a <a href=https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-7rm2 title="Sony Alpha A7RII">Sony Alpha A7RII</a> and the <a href=https://www.zeiss.com/camera-lenses/en_us/camera_lenses/csc/variotessartfe42470za.html title="FE 24-70mm F4 ZA OS">FE 24-70mm F4 ZA O</a> (25mm, f/4.0, 1‚ÅÑ60, ISO 4000).</p><p>I used Adobe Lightroom 6.8 to sharpen, crop and increase the contrast of the image.</p><figure><img class=lazyload data-src=/wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow.jpg data-srcset="/wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_3757d172d5fcc270.jpg 20w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_5291825498d561eb.jpg 320w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_25662e102d284334.jpg 480w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_d9916904efbf64eb.jpg 768w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_606707f306b5537e.jpg 1024w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_c245a24061cdcbb2.jpg 1280w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_4361a912ba588357.jpg 1600w, /wallpaper/2017/week-08/static-flow_hu_77b6803611092e24.jpg 1920w" alt="Static Flow"><figcaption>Static Flow</figcaption></figure><p>Static Flow.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p>Feel free to share, leave a comment or just enjoy looking at it.</p></ul><ul><li><a href=/wallpaper/2017/week-09/>Weekly Wallpaper Week 09/2017</a></li><h2 id=wallpaper-week-092017>Wallpaper Week 09/2017</h2><h2 id=howdy>Howdy</h2><p>New York February 2005.
