&lt;p>Every Monday, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the photo, that will be my Desktop background for one week. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by myself. I&amp;rsquo;ll release them in the highest availble quality. If you like a photo, you can &lt;strong>download it for your personal use&lt;/strong>. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and year.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
