&lt;p>I was working on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ingorichter/Biorhythm">small project&lt;/a> to sharpen my Javascript and Typescript skills. Nothing fancy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project deals with data calculations, and I was looking for a modern replacement of momentjs. I found &lt;a href="https://day.js.org/en/">dayjs&lt;/a>, which seemed to be a suitable replacement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned, I had to find the number of days between the two dates. The documentation of dayjs mentioned a method to calculate the difference between two dates as duration. The duration could then be represented as days. That is exactly what I needed for my calculations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
