&lt;h3 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On July 31, 2023, I received my US Citizenship certificate during the Oath Ceremony at the USCIS Field Office in San Francisco. The whole process from filing BBG to certificate took ~22 Months. There was a delay in the biometrics appointment since I was in Germany for a more extended period. I now have German and US Citizenship and can freely roam between countries.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
