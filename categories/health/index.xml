I had numerous doctor visits, and after several tests, the issue was diagnosed, and I received treatment. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much better now. One thing the doctor ordered me to do is to lose weight - a lot of weight (~70 lbs) - and it should happen quickly. Another motivation to lose weight is to look better in my son&amp;rsquo;s graduation pictures in May.</description></item></channel></rss>
