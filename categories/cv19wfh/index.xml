&lt;p&gt;I had some random thoughts the other day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention of Smartphones and the evolution of built-in cameras was a big step forward in reducing friction to asking random people at scenic spots to take a picture of yourself. Do you remember the days you had to instruct people how to use the camera? How to focus, and which button to press before taking a picture? All this instructional talk was eliminated when smartphones started to take over our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 896</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/08/day896/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/08/day896/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-896"&gt;WFH Day 896&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on too many things at once. The most important one is to replace my Synology NAS with a new one that I built from scratch. My friend was always telling me how great and reliable his &lt;a href="https://www.truenas.com"&gt;TrueNAS&lt;/a&gt; system is working for him. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m replacing my Synology NAS with a more powerful TrueNAS system with a more powerful CPU, RAM and Storage. It&amp;rsquo;s a steep learning curve to find my way configuring the new machine. It&amp;rsquo;s also a great way to clean up my existing data storage and rethink some of the services I have running on my old NAS. I believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing to do with the new NAS. More commodity hardware and less vendor lock in. Never a boring day and always something new to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 870</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/08/day870/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/08/day870/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-870"&gt;WFH Day 870&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long time no update. I was pretty occupied at work getting some larger projects off the ground. The projects are currently in midair and need only occasional course adjustments to arrive at their final destination in the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer is thankfully shutting down the offices in the US for the 4th of July week. Everybody is out of the office and getting some prescribed rest. I decided to move my PTO beginning the week after the company shut down. My family arrived from Germany during the company shutdown week. So, I got a quiet week and could work on a lot of stuff uninterrupted. That was great, and I&amp;rsquo;m thankful my Manager is flexible to support of my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 782</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/05/day782/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/05/day782/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="stepping-into-the-void"&gt;Stepping into the Void&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, May 6th, is the first time since the start of the Pandemic that I stepped inside our office. This time in San Jose. We wanted to celebrate a milestone with our team. The office was empty, and I saw only a handful of people. It was great to see my team and have lunch with them.
Driving to the office sucked. As expected. Too many cars on the road, and the traffic in the Bay Area is horrific in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 778</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/05/day778/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/05/day778/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="global-day-off"&gt;Global Day Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my employer, I had an additional Day Off. To take care of myself and spend time away from my Computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That clearly didn&amp;rsquo;t work out as planned. I didn&amp;rsquo;t stay away from my Computer. I had to clean up some mess I created on my work machine. Open browser tabs accumulated and I need to save some of them for later reference, some emails I put off for some time and some personal programming projects that I put off for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 761</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/04/day761/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/04/day761/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-761"&gt;WFH Day 761&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my employer, I had an additional Day Off. To take care of myself and spend time away from my Computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went out for a hike up Mission Peak in Fremont, California. I heard about it and wanted to do it for quite some time.
It was a great adventure. It was challenging, and I was tired like hell afterward. I got a sunburn on my face. Not great.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 744</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/03/day744/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/03/day744/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-744"&gt;WFH Day 744&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a whole week now since we can&amp;rsquo;t use any water in the house due to a clogged sewage pipe between the property and the main sewer pipe. That clogged pipe led to a flooding of the bathroom in the basement. Bad experience&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several plumbing companies showed up and couldn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the problem. Some broke their machines snaking through the pipe.
That wasn&amp;rsquo;t very reassuring to hear.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 736</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/03/day736/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/03/day736/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-736"&gt;WFH Day 736&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24348088W/Out_of_Office"&gt;Out of Office - The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working from Home&lt;/a&gt; and I have a couple of pages left before this loan expires. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating book about what happens to the office and what other effects those changes will bring for cities and communities in general. There is a lot to think about in the future. And what defines the people that lost the defining part of their lives. I recommend reading the book and seeing what the future might look like and where you find yourself in that new environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 702</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/02/day702/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/02/day702/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-702"&gt;WFH Day 702&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, well, well, I surpassed the 700 days since I started counting the WFH days in March 2020. That&amp;rsquo;s a long time ago, and a lot has changed in the meantime. Quality of life is better than before. No 3-hour daily commute in sticky and filthy trains, no more coffee shop visits after work, more time for reading, better-equipped work environment, not meeting some of my dearest co-workers in person anymore, taking lunch break walks, taking a nap if I don&amp;rsquo;t feel well, not seeing the dirty City anymore and feeling more productive in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 693</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/02/day693/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/02/day693/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-693"&gt;WFH Day 693&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in California for a week now, and my Jetlag is finally gone. Every time I travel to Germany, it feels like it&amp;rsquo;ll take longer to recover. And this week, I had a lot of meetings and tons of work to finish our development sprint. Not great, but I punched through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 657</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/01/day657/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/01/day657/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-657"&gt;WFH Day 657&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you all had a great party to start the new year. Let&amp;rsquo;s all hope that we stay healthy and safe given the uncertainty of the still ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New year, new beginnings. Everything is possible, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to some exciting times. I still have the company-provided sabbatical that I must take this year (it will expire otherwise).
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to traveling to Yosemite in February, Nashville in April, Germany in June. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have concrete plans for the remaining six months of 2022 yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 616</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/11/day616/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/11/day616/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-616"&gt;WFH Day 616&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four weeks in Germany with my wife and some of my children. Part of the time, I had some PTO and was able to meet with friends and family. The remaining time I was either working or renovating the new place for my wife. Usually working at my desk using my brain, it was a welcome change of pace to work with my hands and do more manual labor tasks. After seven consecutive days of manual work stripping carpet, removing wallpaper, painting, removing old furniture and crazy wood ceiling decorations, I was looking forward to having a small break. My whole body was aching, and every step hurts :-)
I&amp;rsquo;m on my way back to California before returning to Germany in 4 weeks for Christmas break and to finalize the new place. There is always something to do in a new place&amp;hellip;
I always wanted to say that I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to live in California and periodically work remotely from Germany. Glad my employer gives me that freedom. Especially during these challenging times when traveling is not always straightforward.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the day that my family will travel to California without any restrictions.
I need to remind myself to stay positive and hope for the best as time goes by. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way to keep my sanity and don&amp;rsquo;t lose sight of better times for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 438</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day438/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day438/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-438"&gt;WFH Day 438&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it. We are all waiting for the pandemic to be over. Everybody wants their normal pre-pandemic life back. But will this be possible? What exactly do we mean by saying that? What do we consider normal life? Meeting with friends in person? Meeting anybody in person? Being able to leave your face mask at home? Getting rid of all the restrictions is probably the most important thing for many of us (it&amp;rsquo;s only a guess).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 421</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-421"&gt;WFH Day 421&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up this morning by 6 am, jumped into my running gear, and headed outside by 6:30 am for a short 2 miles run. It was exhausting, and I was slow. But what&amp;rsquo;s more important: I did it anyway! It took me 24m and 28s. Slow as hell, but I need to start somewhere to get better. This is a start.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 414</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day414/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/05/day414/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-414"&gt;WFH Day 414&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable, but it&amp;rsquo;s already May of 2021! Time flies like crazy, and we are in month 15 of the pandemic. It looks like the US is speeding up things a lot, and people get vaccinated in large quantities. I got my vaccine three weeks ago. This upcoming Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll receive my 2nd shot, and then I should be fully vaccinated two weeks later.
The situation is not so great in Germany. Everything goes so slowly, and they are technically still in lockdown. This lockdown started beginning of November 2020. I was there to visit my family. There were short interruptions of the lockdown for Christmas (what a stupid idea) and again for Easter (why?!?). Germany has this Jojo effect that they wanted to avoid at any cost, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree on a stricter lockdown. And then they didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough vaccines to vaccinate the people on the top of the priority list. Everything moves so fu&amp;hellip;ing slowly there. And now they are facing another crisis: should people who are fully vaccinated get back some or all of their rights? This discussion is so tiring, and it will only drag everything on for longer than necessary, IMHO. I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard anybody here in the US talk discuss this issue.
Out of respect for people who couldn&amp;rsquo;t be vaccinated yet, because they are not eligible yet or because they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough vaccine, all other people that are fully vaccinated or tested negative should not go along with their life? This is the problem of keeping everything restricted and unpleasant until the critical mass has been vaccinated or would be able to get the vaccine. How long will this go on? Throughout the summer? Fall? What&amp;rsquo;s the perspective? What&amp;rsquo;s the reasoning behind delaying it further and further? Is it only about fairness in society? Agree on the lowest common denominator for what is allowed for the whole population? Is this the solution and perspective that everybody in Germany needs right now? I can&amp;rsquo;t disagree more. Anyway, I already said way too much about this ongoing issue.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll travel to Germany beginning of June, and I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that there won&amp;rsquo;t be many things possible for my family and me. We&amp;rsquo;ll see. I can bring up my blood pressure when I arrive there ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WFH Day 365</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day365/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day365/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-365"&gt;WFH Day 365&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took some time during the weekend to minimize my belongings. What does that mean? I got rid of some redundant electronics in the Garage. I threw out some old clothes that clogged my closet. I organized my 3D Printer setup and reduced duplicate tools, and put the wanted stuff in some boxes to keep some order. I trashed some boxes with stuff that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even remember made it during the move&amp;hellip; There is so much more to minimize. This is an ongoing process, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to minimize every day a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;m getting step by step closer to the goal of having less stuff in my life. Only what I want and what gives me happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day353</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-353"&gt;WFH Day 353&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep too bad last night. I got up at around 7:15 am, made myself a coffee, and continued to read my current book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55505679-gerta"&gt;Gerta&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t put time aside for reading, I will never finish any longer book in a finite amount of time. Reading in bed at night is something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly, and then my Kindle, or even worse, my iPad, falls to my face. If I start reading in the morning or during lunch break, I have a real chance to finish a book. I challenged myself to read 20 books this year. I need to increase the pace; otherwise, I won&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day350</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-350"&gt;WFH Day 350&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already the last day of a perfect month. Perfect in that sense that the month started with a Monday and ended adequately on a Sunday. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that I was about to create my sourdough starter. It was an experiment, and I failed it. I assume that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the right place in my house with sufficient constant temperature (this house is so badly insulated :-|). It&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that I don&amp;rsquo;t have ice flowers on the windows on some mornings. Anyway, my experiment failed, and the dough didn&amp;rsquo;t rise as needed. I thought that I&amp;rsquo;d be able to make my bread with my starter by the end of February. I will give it another try, and this time I will place the starter in the Bathroom. That seems to be the warmest place in the house. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this will work out.
Failed experiments are part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day340</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-340"&gt;WFH Day 340&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my lunch break, I took a walk and visited my friends who own a coffee shop in our town. Yesterday, they told me that they would get their vaccination today. I was amazed to hear that since my healthcare provider is sending me weekly updates about the actual vaccination progress and that they vaccinate people over 75. It looks like I still have to wait a bit longer since they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough vaccines for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day329</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day329/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-329"&gt;WFH Day 329&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new year, and still, we are mostly trapped and confined in our homes without much todo. The days seem to follow the same pattern day in, day out. I went back to exercise more, not to feel brain tired, and have something accomplished with my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day310</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/01/day310/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/01/day310/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-310"&gt;WFH Day 310&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in Germany visiting my family. The Lockdown is strict, and just the essential stores are open. The infections are still pretty high, and the government talks about more restrictions to bring down the numbers. It feels that there is nothing I can do more at this point. I stay and work from home. I go outside for a walk around the lake and get some groceries. I can&amp;rsquo;t see my siblings or my parents. Two of my friends walk with me around the lake at a safe distance. We can yell a each other, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a pleasant conversation. I wonder if any of the new restrictions will help to reduce the infections and deaths. And when will it start to show any significant effect?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day240</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day240/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day240/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-240"&gt;WFH Day 240&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time off last week, I&amp;rsquo;m finally back to work. I felt mentally exhausted and tired to the point of not having any motivation to do anything despite reading, hanging around, and sleeping. I made silly mistakes during the last minute changes that my teammates had to fix while I was gone. And to be honest, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day218</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day218/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day218/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-218"&gt;WFH Day 218&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the day! &lt;a href="https://max.adobe.com"&gt;Adobe MAX&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and all the work of the previous months could be seen by everybody interested in our products. What a fantastic achievement in these crazy times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still fighting with a couple of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my 3D Printer drives me crazy (filament clogged the extruder, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the Teflon tube I needed to replace)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working on some authentication-related issues for the CSDK, and it moves slow and brought up some obstacles along the way that makes the implementation more expensive. I think that I found a solution that I need to finalize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to my trip to Germany this Saturday. Not that Germany is the best place to travel right now, but I want to be there for my little daughter&amp;rsquo;s birthday. And that&amp;rsquo;s important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day205</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day205/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day205/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-205"&gt;WFH Day 205&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on some very tricky programming issues at work. Things are moving slowly, and there are times when I think what the hell am I doing here. Luckily, this is a temporary state and will only get worse by working on something entirely different. Right, working on the &lt;a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/october-leetcoding-challenge"&gt;leetcode October challenge&lt;/a&gt; can show me that things can get worse. Last night I spent 3 hours! On a simple (in retrospect, it was a straightforward) problem. Inserting something into a BST and return the resulting BST. Perhaps it was too late, I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay enough attention to the little details along the way, but I got something working on my machine, and when I pasted it into the leetcode editor, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working anymore. Great! WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING?! I got it working locally, and now this. Sigh. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the points for that day, and I went to bed slightly frustrated about the outcome. Anyway, it should be fun and entertaining, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day200</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day200/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day200/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-200"&gt;WFH Day 200&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to celebrate ð&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200 days WFH and mostly isolated and not entirely insane ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have guessed that it will last that long? And there is no end in sight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at something tiny through a Macro Lens. Should we? Just to distract ourselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are getting close to the 200-day mark for work at home. Not necessarily something to celebrate, but a noticeable milestone during these times and a sign that every prediction how long this situation is supposed to last was wrong.
Only a couple of weeks left before the election, and tonight is the first debate between both presidential candidates. To protect my sanity, I&amp;rsquo;ll watch the debate only for 15 mins max. That debate will be a battle that I can&amp;rsquo;t stand.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day192</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day192/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day192/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-192"&gt;WFH Day 192&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are approaching the final days of our Sprint. The majority of our clients are happy and don&amp;rsquo;t have significant functionality issues that would require our team to do some fire fighting. I was able to finish one last-minute task for a hotfix and another task for this release. In addition to finalizing both tasks, I was able to review some PRs and provide some feedback. I feel pretty accomplished today, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to tomorrow. Last workday of this week ð¸&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day189</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day189/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day189/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-189"&gt;WFH Day 189&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a &amp;ldquo;Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day&amp;rdquo;. I tried to make the best out of it. No luck. I woke up feeling like a truck rolled over my body. I pushed through the day and went for a run in the evening. Tomorrow is a new day. Looking forward to a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day186</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day186/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day186/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-186"&gt;WFH Day 186&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a great day! You may ask why it was a great day. Let me tell you that my employer is giving us a day off. On Fridays. Every three weeks. Until the end of the year! If this is not great, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to spark some fun. At least for the moment.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know when it was the last time that I needed an additional day to recover. I love my job. For sure, it has its ups and downs. But in general, I love what I do. But I feel tired recently, and everything seems to need a lot of energy to move it forward. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s only me or a sign of the circumstances we currently live through. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful to have a job and contribute to something that means something to me. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always spark joy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day184</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day184/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day184/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-184"&gt;WFH Day 184&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a day. A lot of meetings in the morning. After I finished all of them right before the lunch break, I found &lt;a href="https://apple.news/AJDAk76ilQYm-ssffOZlwog"&gt;Beat Burnout And Zoom Fatigue: 3 Ways To Fight Stress And Stay Motivated During Coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; in my news feed today. Although I consider myself mindful and remind myself to take breaks during the day, exercise my aching body, I still sometimes feel tired and not motivated to my full extent. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s a result of all the meetings to stay connected with my teammates and friends and family. But I can feel the pressure that is building up. The pace is high, and the work seems to be endless. It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that I&amp;rsquo;m running out of tasks, but I need to be more disciplined about stopping on time and not going back to work after dinner. I will do better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day183</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day183/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day183/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-183"&gt;WFH Day 183&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many T-shirts do I need? I did laundry today and was folding up my stuff. I was looking in my closet and found at least 20 T-Shirts and the additional pile of 15 T-shirts freshly laundered. I need to get rid of some of them. There is so much stuff in my life that it distracts me from more important things. I have this pile of desk supplies lying on the ground next to my desk. I have a todo item on my list to put them into the drawer or throw them away. I think tomorrow will be a fine day to start doing that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day182</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day182/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day182/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-182"&gt;WFH Day 182&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a looong time that we are now hanging out at home. We won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the office anytime soon. So, we are stuck inside our homes for much longer. And because of the horrible air quality I can&amp;rsquo;t even go outside and exercise. It seems that this year brings all the catastrophes (pandemic, global warming, extreme heat and wildfires) in one go. This is usual material that science fictions stories are made of. Now we have to live through it in reality. We will all be alright. Some way or the other. No time to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day178</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-178"&gt;WFH Day 178&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to work from home we got really bad air quality. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see the sun since yesterdays orange tint. Today was not as bad as yesterday, but still no sun and it was gloomy as hell. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you any energy boost to get through the day. And don&amp;rsquo;t think about outside exercise. Trying to do something healthy gets in the way with the outside conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day26</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wfh-day-26"&gt;WFH Day #26&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we got the notification from Adobe that we will close all the offices for all employees in north America. We were told to work from home for the next 30 days. After that period the situation will be evaluated and further decisions will be communicated by then. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
