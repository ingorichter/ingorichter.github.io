We won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the office anytime soon. So, we are stuck inside our homes for much longer. And because of the horrible air quality I can&amp;rsquo;t even go outside and exercise. It seems that this year brings all the catastrophes (pandemic, global warming, extreme heat and wildfires) in one go. This is usual material that science fictions stories are made of.</description></item><item><title>Day178</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</guid><description>WFH Day 178 In addition to work from home we got really bad air quality. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see the sun since yesterdays orange tint. Today was not as bad as yesterday, but still no sun and it was gloomy as hell. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you any energy boost to get through the day. And don&amp;rsquo;t think about outside exercise. Trying to do something healthy gets in the way with the outside conditions.</description></item><item><title>Day26</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</guid><description>WFH Day #26 Photo by Viktor Nikolaienko on Unsplash unsplash-logoViktor Nikolaienko</description></item><item><title>Day1</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day1/</guid><description>WFH Day 001 Today we got the notification from Adobe that we will close all the offices for all employees in north America. we were told to work from home for the next 30 days.
