Why? It expresses very clearly to me, that you need to get active, if you want to reach a goal in your life. No matter what it is. Get a promotion, earn more money, hike the Pacific Crest Trail.</description></item><item><title>Don't say it.

Don’t overthink everything.
Don’t make it more complicated than it has to be.
Don’t stop learning.
Don’t stop trying.
Try harder.
Try smarter.
Don’t say “it’s impossible”.
Move faster.
Do it!</description></item></channel></rss>
