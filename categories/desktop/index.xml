I&amp;rsquo;ll give a description of the subject, where it was taken and what the camera settings were (if I remember them). All photos will be taken by myself. I&amp;rsquo;ll release them in the highest availble quality. If you like a photo, you can download it for your personal use. Each photo contains a watermark with my name and year.</description></item></channel></rss>
