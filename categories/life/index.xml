&lt;p>Woah, we have already surpassed the four-month mark for this year. A lot of things have happened in the last four months.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>In January, I was reassigned to my new team. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m working on our products&amp;rsquo; &lt;em>Share and Review&lt;/em> functionality. I&amp;rsquo;m back to Web Development + plus a little bit of &lt;a href="https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/" title="UXP">UXP&lt;/a> (proprietary Tech) that enables us to target our Desktop Apps with the same JS/TS code base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spent 40 days in Germany from March through Easter in April. My son&amp;rsquo;s exchange partner from Ireland stayed with us for three weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In February, I applied for US citizenship. Unfortunately, I had to cancel three biometrics submission appointments because I was in Germany and didn&amp;rsquo;t expect USCIS to ask so quickly to appear in person. Now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything from USCIS for a month. I assume that they put me at the end of the queue. Sigh&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A friend passed away after some long struggle in March. Rest in Peace, Peter 🥲. I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After two years of waiting for my invitation to order the new &lt;a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/?gnav=header-electrified-vhp" title="Ford F-150 Lightning">Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a> truck, it&amp;rsquo;s now my turn. I have time to decide until 5/8/2023 if I want to order it. After waiting a long time, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s an appropriate car for me. I like the idea of having an electric truck. It seemed the best way to justify such a big, unreasonable car. Given the state of competition in the EV market space and the crazy price hike for the F-150 since its introduction, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I feel excited about buying this truck. And then, there are rumors about technical issues with the F-150 that would delay the delivery by several months. No, thank you. Anyway, it was an exciting idea and something that kept me dreaming&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I started to exercise daily. Mobility and strength exercises to prevent problems with my body. I had a back issue last summer that lasted nearly six months. They only went away after some severe mobility and stretching exercise. I got a copy of &lt;a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL39377234M" title="Built To Move">Built to Move&lt;/a>. The book talks about the importance of keeping the body moving.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. I hope the weather will improve in the coming weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s frigid and rainy for this time of year. One of the positives of the weather situation is that the wildfires are probably pushed out later this year 🤞🏼 I hope the best that the wildfire season doesn&amp;rsquo;t get so crazy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
