I spent four weeks in Germany with my wife and some of my children. Part of the time, I had some PTO and was able to meet with friends and family. The remaining time I was either working or renovating the new place for my wife. Usually working at my desk using my brain, it was a welcome change of pace to work with my hands and do more manual labor tasks. After seven consecutive days of manual work stripping carpet, removing wallpaper, painting, removing old furniture and crazy wood ceiling decorations, I was looking forward to having a small break. My whole body was aching, and every step hurts :-)
I&rsquo;m on my way back to California before returning to Germany in 4 weeks for Christmas break and to finalize the new place. There is always something to do in a new place&mldr;
I always wanted to say that I&rsquo;m grateful to live in California and periodically work remotely from Germany. Glad my employer gives me that freedom. Especially during these challenging times when traveling is not always straightforward.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day that my family will travel to California without any restrictions.
I need to remind myself to stay positive and hope for the best as time goes by. That&rsquo;s the only way to keep my sanity and don&rsquo;t lose sight of better times for all of us."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/11/day616/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="WFH Day 616"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 616 I spent four weeks in Germany with my wife and some of my children.
