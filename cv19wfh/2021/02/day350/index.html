It&rsquo;s already the last day of a perfect month. Perfect in that sense that the month started with a Monday and ended adequately on a Sunday. :-)
I mentioned in my post that I was about to create my sourdough starter. It was an experiment, and I failed it. I assume that I didn&rsquo;t have the right place in my house with sufficient constant temperature (this house is so badly insulated :-|). It&rsquo;s a wonder that I don&rsquo;t have ice flowers on the windows on some mornings. Anyway, my experiment failed, and the dough didn&rsquo;t rise as needed. I thought that I&rsquo;d be able to make my bread with my starter by the end of February. I will give it another try, and this time I will place the starter in the Bathroom. That seems to be the warmest place in the house. Let&rsquo;s see how this will work out.
Failed experiments are part of the learning process."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,DIY,Flower,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day350/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day350"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 350 Itâ€™s already the last day of a perfect month.
