During my lunch break, I took a walk and visited my friends who own a coffee shop in our town. Yesterday, they told me that they would get their vaccination today. I was amazed to hear that since my healthcare provider is sending me weekly updates about the actual vaccination progress and that they vaccinate people over 75. It looks like I still have to wait a bit longer since they don&rsquo;t have enough vaccines for this age group."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day340"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 340 During my lunch break, I took a walk and visited my friends who own a coffee shop in our town.

</content><content><h2 id=wfh-day-340>WFH Day 340</h2><p>During my lunch break, I took a walk and visited my friends who own a coffee shop in our town. Yesterday, they told me that they would get their vaccination today. I was amazed to hear that since my healthcare provider is sending me weekly updates about the actual vaccination progress and that they vaccinate people over 75. It looks like I still have to wait a bit longer since they don&rsquo;t have enough vaccines for this age group.</p><p>My friends told me that they arrived at the vaccination site, and nobody checked for their eligibility. Nothing. Nada. They had an appointment because they belong to the food worker group, and this group is getting their vaccine right now. My friend said I should sign up for an appointment and see what happens.
It makes me feel bad to skip the line since I&rsquo;m not part of a risk group. I should wait. Other people need it more right now: Teachers, Service Worker, and everybody who has contact with various people during the day.</p><p>After nearly working a year from home, there is some visible progress in fighting this pandemic. We will all get our shots once there is enough vaccine. Until then, we have to wait until it&rsquo;s our turn.</p><p>I found something beautiful on my way back home.</p><figure><img class=lazyload data-src=/cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower.jpg data-srcset="/cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_227363f494c8a3e3.jpg 20w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_432bea861d9d3b38.jpg 320w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_7f20146c5b6e0706.jpg 480w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_5202632ddfa61ecd.jpg 768w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_c142ea256144bc31.jpg 1024w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_efb13656196cbec7.jpg 1280w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_8a03cbe9d0278169.jpg 1600w, /cv19wfh/2021/02/day340/pinkflower_hu_55e7106f6e3831f8.jpg 1920w" alt="Pink Flower I found along the way walking in the neighborhood"><figcaption>Pink Flower I found along the way walking in the neighborhood</figcaption></figure><details><summary>Shot Details</summary><ul><li>Date: February 17, 2021</li><li>Aperture: 1.60</li><li>Brightness: 10.50</li><li>Exposure Time: 31524/177101831</li><li>F Number: 8/5</li><li>Focal Length: 51/10</li><li>Lens Model: iPhone 12 Pro Max back triple camera 5.1mm f/1.6</li></ul></details><p>Mahalo ðŸŒ¸</p></content><p><a href=/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
