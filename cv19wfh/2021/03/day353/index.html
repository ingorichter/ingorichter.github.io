</content><content><h2 id=wfh-day-353>WFH Day 353</h2><p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep too bad last night. I got up at around 7:15 am, made myself a coffee, and continued to read my current book <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55505679-gerta>Gerta</a>. I&rsquo;m a slow reader, and if I don&rsquo;t put time aside for reading, I will never finish any longer book in a finite amount of time. Reading in bed at night is something that doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I usually fall asleep pretty quickly, and then my Kindle, or even worse, my iPad, falls to my face. If I start reading in the morning or during lunch break, I have a real chance to finish a book. I challenged myself to read 20 books this year. I need to increase the pace; otherwise, I won&rsquo;t make it.</p><p>I was reading <a href=https://elainecchao.medium.com/9-life-lessons-from-a-year-of-shelter-in-place-26de1ea19b2d>this post</a> by my co-worker today. It&rsquo;s an excellent summary of the last year. I can&rsquo;t entirely agree with every aspect of the post, but overall, it covers many topics that kept me and others around me busy and thinking.</p><p>Sometimes people ask me what I&rsquo;m reading or Music/Podcast I&rsquo;m listening to right now. If you asked me, I would tell you that I started listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/42xagXCUDsFO6a0lcHoTlv?si=kMkXPdnfTwWiB4wr-yclMA">Renegades</a> on Spotify. It&rsquo;s a casual conversation between Barack Obama and Bruce &ldquo;The Boss&rdquo; Springsteen. I like both of them for various reasons, and they talk about their upbringing and the current state of the World. I was listening to it on my evening walk, which kept me walking a little longer. You might like it.</p><p>The tree in front of the house looks beautiful right now with all the new blossoms and this light rose color.</p><figure><img class=lazyload data-src=https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms.jpg data-srcset="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_80e287b9a593c5.jpg 20w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_be36f05d9733fafc.jpg 320w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_ab4ceb376b062e36.jpg 480w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_63b2a8877144a452.jpg 768w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_54b13d6926b90f5e.jpg 1024w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_1f78ccf3e547234b.jpg 1280w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_6a0d7335926b8e1f.jpg 1600w, https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/03/day353/blossoms_hu_c083eaa5418d9bc7.jpg 1920w" alt="Blossoms of a Cherry or Plum"><figcaption>Blossoms of a Cherry or Plum</figcaption></figure><details><summary>Shot Details</summary><ul><li>Date: February 27, 2021</li><li>Aperture: 22.00</li><li>Brightness: 6.76</li><li>Exposure Time: 1/13</li><li>F Number: 22</li><li>Focal Length: 105</li><li>Lens Model: EF24-105/4L IS USM</li></ul></details><p>Mahalo ðŸŒ¸</p></content><p><a href=https://ingo-richter.io/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
