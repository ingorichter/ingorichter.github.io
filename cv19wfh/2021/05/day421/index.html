I got up this morning by 6 am, jumped into my running gear, and headed outside by 6:30 am for a short 2 miles run. It was exhausting, and I was slow. But what&rsquo;s more important: I did it anyway! It took me 24m and 28s. Slow as hell, but I need to start somewhere to get better.

It was exhausting, and I was slow. But what&rsquo;s more important: I did it anyway! It took me 24m and 28s. Slow as hell, but I need to start somewhere to get better. This is a start.</p><p>Back home, I found this <a href=http://www.robinhobb.com/blog/posts/38429>blog post</a>. I loved the story about the tired Animal. And it&rsquo;s so relatable for me. I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details about my life and why it reminds me of myself.
Take care of yourself. Be kind to yourself, stop for the beautiful things in life, and treat yourself like a good friend. YOLO!</p><figure><img class=lazyload data-src=/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy.jpg data-srcset="/cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_74fd629cf2f3e075.jpg 20w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_8e7214ca84e9debf.jpg 320w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_80930b20dcdb7b19.jpg 480w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_7bf9b5e209a0b52d.jpg 768w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_d6321291430f841d.jpg 1024w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_c7f28f0d4c2b377d.jpg 1280w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_19f9da9f45588db9.jpg 1600w, /cv19wfh/2021/05/day421/spikypoppy_hu_efaddf5bb0664412.jpg 1920w" alt="Red Poppy in the sunlight."><figcaption>Red Poppy in the sunlight.</figcaption></figure><details><summary>Shot Details</summary><ul><li>Date: May 03, 2021</li><li>Aperture: 4.00</li><li>Brightness: 7.74</li><li>Exposure Time: 1/5000</li><li>F Number: 4</li><li>Focal Length: 105</li><li>Lens Model: EF24-105/4L IS USM</li></ul></details><p>Mahalo ðŸŒ¸</p></content><p><a href=/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
