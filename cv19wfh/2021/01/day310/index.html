I&rsquo;m currently in Germany visiting my family. The Lockdown is strict, and just the essential stores are open. The infections are still pretty high, and the government talks about more restrictions to bring down the numbers. It feels that there is nothing I can do more at this point. I stay and work from home. I go outside for a walk around the lake and get some groceries. I can&rsquo;t see my siblings or my parents. Two of my friends walk with me around the lake at a safe distance. We can yell a each other, but it&rsquo;s not a pleasant conversation. I wonder if any of the new restrictions will help to reduce the infections and deaths. And when will it start to show any significant effect?"><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2021/01/day310/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day310"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 310 Iâ€™m currently in Germany visiting my family.
