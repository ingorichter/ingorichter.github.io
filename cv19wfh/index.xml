A lot of meetings in the morning. After I finished all of them right before the lunch break, I found Beat Burnout And Zoom Fatigue: 3 Ways To Fight Stress And Stay Motivated During Coronavirus in my news feed today. Although I consider myself mindful and remind myself to take breaks during the day, exercise my aching body, I still sometimes feel tired and not motivated to my full extent.</description></item><item><title>Day183</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day183/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day183/</guid><description>WFH Day 183 How many T-shirts do I need? I did laundry today and was folding up my stuff. I was looking in my closet and found at least 20 T-Shirts and the additional pile of 15 T-shirts freshly laundered. I need to get rid of some of them. There is so much stuff in my life that it distracts me from more important things. I have this pile of desk supplies lying on the ground next to my desk.</description></item><item><title>Day182</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day182/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day182/</guid><description>WFH Day 182 That is a looong time that we are now hanging out at home. We won&amp;rsquo;t go back to the office anytime soon. So, we are stuck inside our homes for much longer. And because of the horrible air quality I can&amp;rsquo;t even go outside and exercise. It seems that this year brings all the catastrophes (pandemic, global warming, extreme heat and wildfires) in one go. This is usual material that science fictions stories are made of.</description></item><item><title>Day178</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day178/</guid><description>WFH Day 178 In addition to work from home we got really bad air quality. We didn&amp;rsquo;t see the sun since yesterdays orange tint. Today was not as bad as yesterday, but still no sun and it was gloomy as hell. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you any energy boost to get through the day. And don&amp;rsquo;t think about outside exercise. Trying to do something healthy gets in the way with the outside conditions.</description></item><item><title>Day26</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day26/</guid><description>WFH Day #26 Photo by Viktor Nikolaienko on Unsplash unsplash-logoViktor Nikolaienko</description></item><item><title>Day1</title><link>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day1/</guid><description>WFH Day 001 Today we got the notification from Adobe that we will close all the offices for all employees in north America. we were told to work from home for the next 30 days.
