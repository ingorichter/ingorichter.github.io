After some time off last week, I&rsquo;m finally back to work. I felt mentally exhausted and tired to the point of not having any motivation to do anything despite reading, hanging around, and sleeping. I made silly mistakes during the last minute changes that my teammates had to fix while I was gone. And to be honest, that wasn&rsquo;t a great feeling."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day240/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day240"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 240 After some time off last week, I’m finally back to work.

I felt mentally exhausted and tired to the point of not having any motivation to do anything despite reading, hanging around, and sleeping. I made silly mistakes during the last minute changes that my teammates had to fix while I was gone. And to be honest, that wasn&rsquo;t a great feeling.</p><p>I feel better now, and I have more energy to tackle some of the more challenging work problems.
The most significant change for me recently was to walk and run daily. It&rsquo;s freeing up my mind, and I feel great that my watch tells me that I accomplished my move and exercise goals at the end of the day. Mission accomplished.</p><p>This morning a met a longtime friend for a 3 1/2 mile walk around the nearby lake. The weather was not so great (as usual this time of year here in Germany), but walking and talking was a great way to connect with my friend after a long time. So, it was a great day after all.</p><figure style="padding:.25rem;margin:2rem 0;background-color:#cccc"><img style=max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto src=https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day240/FallLeaves_hu_245e10ab122d1f1e.jpg width=1600 height=1067><figcaption><small><pre><code>  Colorful
