How many T-shirts do I need? I did laundry today and was folding up my stuff. I was looking in my closet and found at least 20 T-Shirts and the additional pile of 15 T-shirts freshly laundered. I need to get rid of some of them. There is so much stuff in my life that it distracts me from more important things. I have this pile of desk supplies lying on the ground next to my desk. I have a todo item on my list to put them into the drawer or throw them away. I think tomorrow will be a fine day to start doing that."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day183/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day183"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 183 How many T-shirts do I need?
