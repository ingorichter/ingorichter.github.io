Today was the day! Adobe MAX arrived, and all the work of the previous months could be seen by everybody interested in our products. What a fantastic achievement in these crazy times.
I&rsquo;m still fighting with a couple of things.

my 3D Printer drives me crazy (filament clogged the extruder, and I didn&rsquo;t have the Teflon tube I needed to replace)
working on some authentication-related issues for the CSDK, and it moves slow and brought up some obstacles along the way that makes the implementation more expensive. I think that I found a solution that I need to finalize

Otherwise, I&rsquo;m looking forward to my trip to Germany this Saturday. Not that Germany is the best place to travel right now, but I want to be there for my little daughter&rsquo;s birthday. And that&rsquo;s important to me."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day218/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day218"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 218 Today was the day!
