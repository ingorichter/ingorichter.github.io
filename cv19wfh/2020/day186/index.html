Today was a great day! You may ask why it was a great day. Let me tell you that my employer is giving us a day off. On Fridays. Every three weeks. Until the end of the year! If this is not great, I don&rsquo;t know how to spark some fun. At least for the moment.
I don&rsquo;t know when it was the last time that I needed an additional day to recover. I love my job. For sure, it has its ups and downs. But in general, I love what I do. But I feel tired recently, and everything seems to need a lot of energy to move it forward. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s only me or a sign of the circumstances we currently live through. I&rsquo;m thankful to have a job and contribute to something that means something to me. But it doesn&rsquo;t always spark joy."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day186/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="Day186"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 186 Today was a great day!

</content><content><h2 id=wfh-day-186>WFH Day 186</h2><p>Today was a great day! You may ask why it was a great day. Let me tell you that my employer is giving us a day off. On Fridays. Every three weeks. Until the end of the year! If this is not great, I don&rsquo;t know how to spark some fun. At least for the moment.
I don&rsquo;t know when it was the last time that I needed an additional day to recover. I love my job. For sure, it has its ups and downs. But in general, I love what I do. But I feel tired recently, and everything seems to need a lot of energy to move it forward. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s only me or a sign of the circumstances we currently live through. I&rsquo;m thankful to have a job and contribute to something that means something to me. But it doesn&rsquo;t always spark joy.</p><p>I used part of the day to go outside and ride my bicycle for nearly 3 hours over 35 miles and almost 2500 ft elevation. I enjoyed nature, the quietness, and the sun on my body. It was challenging since I didn&rsquo;t work out enough in the past couple of months. But I climbed up the mountains and was happy that I made it to the top. The view was excellent, the air quality was great, and I felt a sense of accomplishment that I could push myself up against that mountain. I felt like a winner. Excellent after months of pushing through work items, meetings, the pandemic, my family living distributed in different countries.
I was so tired and my legs cramped when I arrived back at home. Nonetheless, I felt alive, although my muscles being sore, and my body aching. But better this way than dead.</p><p>Here is a picture from the top of the mountain that I climbed.</p><figure style="padding:.25rem;margin:2rem 0;background-color:#cccc"><img style=max-width:100%;width:auto;height:auto src=https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2020/day186/mountaintop_hu_48d3d6cdab4608e4.jpg width=1600 height=1200><figcaption><small><pre><code>  Top of the mountain
