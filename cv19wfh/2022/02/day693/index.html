I&rsquo;m back in California for a week now, and my Jetlag is finally gone. Every time I travel to Germany, it feels like it&rsquo;ll take longer to recover. And this week, I had a lot of meetings and tons of work to finish our development sprint.

</a><content><h2 id=wfh-day-693>WFH Day 693</h2><p>I&rsquo;m back in California for a week now, and my Jetlag is finally gone. Every time I travel to Germany, it feels like it&rsquo;ll take longer to recover. And this week, I had a lot of meetings and tons of work to finish our development sprint. Not great, but I punched through it.</p><p>Regarding the Jetlag: I tried many things to get back to my rhythm faster, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to work well enough. I exercised every day, and I went to bed around 11 pm every night. I tried to eat healthy as well as I could, no alcohol but lots of water and coffee.</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m back, and I enjoy being in a warmer climate, riding my bicycle in the sun, and using my water rower in the Garage.</p><p>BTW: I took the picture shortly after takeoff from Munich Airport. There were a lot of clouds and strong winds—the reason my flight was canceled the previous day.</p><p>If you like weird TV Shows that sometimes seem absurd and funny, I can recommend <a href=https://www.hbo.com/how-to-with-john-wilson>How To With John Wilson</a>. It&rsquo;s on HBO. Ask a friend if you don&rsquo;t have your account ;-)</p><p>Have a great week, and enjoy whatever you like to do.</p></content><p><a href=/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
