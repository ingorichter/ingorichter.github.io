</a><content><h2 id=wfh-day-744>WFH Day 744</h2><p>It&rsquo;s a whole week now since we can&rsquo;t use any water in the house due to a clogged sewage pipe between the property and the main sewer pipe. That clogged pipe led to a flooding of the bathroom in the basement. Bad experience&mldr;</p><p>Several plumbing companies showed up and couldn&rsquo;t resolve the problem. Some broke their machines snaking through the pipe.
That wasn&rsquo;t very reassuring to hear.</p><p>No running water means no shower, no toilette use, no dishwasher, no laundry, not using any water that might run down the sewer pipe. No cooking at home!</p><p>I&rsquo;m only happy that my family left a couple of days before the incident. My oldest son, who lives with me in the house, went on a trip last Wednesday and returned last night. I try to make the best out of it. Although I feel like a displaced person, I imagine this be a camping trip through the wilderness without access to all modern Western life amenities. A little adventure didn&rsquo;t kill anybody ;-)</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m happy that I don&rsquo;t have to vacate at Starbucks or Peet&rsquo;s Coffee anymore to have a working restroom. We got a portable toilette in front of the garage for the time being.</p><p>The plumbers will come tomorrow, dig out the clogged pipe underneath the road, and replace it. I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting it fixed so that we can use water in the house again. I&rsquo;m so tired right now, and at the same time, it was a reminder that we take so many things for granted in our advanced and modern lives.</p><p>Anyway, this shall pass, and tomorrow everything will hopefully go back to what I&rsquo;m used to.</p><p>Enjoy life and have fun. No matter how bad things seem to be.</p><p>ðŸŒº</p></content><p><a href=https://ingo-richter.io/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
