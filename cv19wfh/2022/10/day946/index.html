Do you remember the days you had to instruct people how to use the camera? How to focus, and which button to press before taking a picture? All this instructional talk was eliminated when smartphones started to take over our lives."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/10/day946/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="WFH Day 946"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 946 I had some random thoughts the other day.

All this instructional talk was eliminated when smartphones started to take over our lives.</p><p>Nowadays, you will hand your phone to somebody without giving them instructions on how to take a picture. Everybody knows that you tap on the screen to set the focus. And the volume button or the on-screen button will take a picture. You can even let them take multiple shots to ensure that there will be at least one usable shot from you. And you can right away check the photo and share it with whoever you think is worth it.</p><p>Mahalo ðŸŒ¸</p></content><p><a href=/blog/wfh/>#WFH</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
