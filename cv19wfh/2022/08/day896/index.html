I&rsquo;m working on too many things at once. The most important one is to replace my Synology NAS with a new one that I built from scratch. My friend was always telling me how great and reliable his TrueNAS system is working for him. Now, I&rsquo;m replacing my Synology NAS with a more powerful TrueNAS system with a more powerful CPU, RAM and Storage. It&rsquo;s a steep learning curve to find my way configuring the new machine. It&rsquo;s also a great way to clean up my existing data storage and rethink some of the services I have running on my old NAS. I believe that it&rsquo;s the right thing to do with the new NAS. More commodity hardware and less vendor lock in. Never a boring day and always something new to learn."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/08/day896/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="WFH Day 896"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 896 Iâ€™m working on too many things at once.

My friend was always telling me how great and reliable his <a href=https://www.truenas.com>TrueNAS</a> system is working for him. Now, I&rsquo;m replacing my Synology NAS with a more powerful TrueNAS system with a more powerful CPU, RAM and Storage. It&rsquo;s a steep learning curve to find my way configuring the new machine.

More commodity hardware and less vendor lock in. Never a boring day and always something new to learn.</p><h2 id=reading>Reading</h2><p>I got better this year, reading more books.</p><p>Recently I finished <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20010616W/Winter_is_coming?edition=ia%3Awinteriscomingwh0000kasp_r8m4">Winter is Coming</a> from Garry Kasparov. Interesting information about the relationship of Russia and the rest of the world. I learned a lot of things about the current political situation and how it developed in the past 50 years.</p><p>I started to read <a href=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25591329W/Someday_Is_Today>Someday is Today</a> from Matthew Dicks. I&rsquo;m at the beginning of the book and there are a lot of things that I already can relate to. It&rsquo;s easy to read and Matthew is a great storyteller, and it&rsquo;s a joy to read.</p><h2 id=photography>Photography</h2><p>I finally spent some time in San Francisco on a Sunday night to walk around <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/140983204#map=17/37.80118/-122.40900">North Beach</a>.
