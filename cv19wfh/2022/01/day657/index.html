Happy New Year!
I hope you all had a great party to start the new year. Let&rsquo;s all hope that we stay healthy and safe given the uncertainty of the still ongoing pandemic.
New year, new beginnings. Everything is possible, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to some exciting times. I still have the company-provided sabbatical that I must take this year (it will expire otherwise).
I&rsquo;m looking forward to traveling to Yosemite in February, Nashville in April, Germany in June. I didn&rsquo;t have concrete plans for the remaining six months of 2022 yet."><meta name=keywords content="WFH,Corona,COVID19,"><meta name=author content="Ingo Richter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ingo-richter.io/cv19wfh/2022/01/day657/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Today is Tomorrow's Past"><meta property="og:title" content="WFH Day 657"><meta property="og:description" content="WFH Day 657 Happy New Year!
